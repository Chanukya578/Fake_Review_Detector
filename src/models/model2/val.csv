I'm 36-27-38 and it was snug- no fear of Hulking though it, but it was snug. I wore a skin colored bra and white tights and didn't feel naked at any point.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"I was interested in this book because of the uncommon setting of St. Louis--a city I love, but one that is definitely falling apart. That decay is beautifully described by Franzen. There's no doubt that the prose in 'The Twenty-Seventh City' nearly always sparkles and only occasionally falls flat, usually when he gets too caught up in his philosophical meanderings inside the head of Martin Probst (who is quietly and slowly lovable). There are so many artful descriptions and astute retellings of every-day occurrences to propel readers. Unfortunately, the interesting premise never expands much beyond its setup in the first 50 pages. S. Jammu and her comrades are interesting, but haughty, and their reasons for taking on their twisted plot are never clarified beyond vague sketches of their activist and corrupted pasts. EVERYone in high society, apparently, enters into either physical or intellectual affairs, which often defy their characterisations, and there are so many characters that are highlighted in their dull everyday routines just to service their importance in the book's ending that it drags down the beginning in middle. And when the climax of a 500-page novel hinges on the outcome of a referendum vote... well, I think that's all that needs to be said about that.
Still, Franzen's observations on our every day lives and interactions are shocking in their familiarity, and he undeniably has a good grip on many facets of how our society and culture functions. Twenty years after the fact his comments are still relevant. 'The Twenty-Seventh City' is worth reading, but only if read quickly; labouring over it and its blunted intricacies is not worth the time."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"first, packaging was TERRIBLE. i know it's a large item, but it was put in two boxes (side to side) and taped with clear packaging tape. just for that they should get 2 stars. a kid would be able to package it better. just terrible.

- the edges always seem to have more paint left over than the middle. not sure if it's my roller or the design
- why is there a trough at the top? what's it for? maybe the brush, but i don't use it.
- holds a lot, easy to apply paint on the roller
- no liner available (that i know of), so it's a pain to clean up (see tip below)

one tip - leave more than a THIN film of paint when you are done, so that when it dries out, you can just peel it off in one swoop. if you try to get every last bit of paint, it's almost impossible to clean the next day (without water or solvents of course). when you don't see the green plastic and it dries out, it will be a piece of cake to take the latex paint off.

i'd buy it again."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Wuliff Tactical Knife with Foldable Blade - 6  Inch Overall Length, Stainless Steel Pocket Knife, Durable Lightweight Design, Secure Locking Mechanism, Rust Resistant, Ultra-Sharp Blade

Exceptional knife, especially for the price!  Even my husband, who collects knives was impressed with this one.  First off, this foldable tactical knife, by Wuliff, shipped fast, and arrived well packaged and in perfect condition.  Knife measures 6.5 inches long by .5 inches by .5 inches, so is a great size for an EDC knife.  Knife is made from stainless steel and is foldable.

The first thing I noticed about this knife, was the design.  It has a nice sleek look to it.  And the handle is comfortable to hold (especially for those, like me, with smaller hands).  Me and my husband both have pocket knives, we carry every day. And we both are avid hikers, campers, outdoors-men, so have quite a few tactical knives.  So, we compared the size and sharpness to those knives (which were double and triple the price of this one).  It was a bit smaller than the knives we were carrying, but this is actually a good thing. It is much more comfortable in your pocket and not bulky, at all.  As far as sharpness,  this was extremely sharp!  I cannot say how long the sharpness will last, or how well it will sharpen back up.  But, after more use and sharpening, I will update this.  Knife is nice and light, yet seems pretty durable.  Have only used it for small jobs, but, so far, it's been great.  Locking mechanism works perfectly and it is easy to open and close.  For the last week, my husband has replaced his regular knife, with this one and loves it.  Is this knife as good as a K-bar or SOG? No, but it also doesn't cost close to those.  For the price, this is a great every day pocket knife."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"When is the next book??  Wow!  This was sooo good!  It was very hard for me to put this book down once I started it.

The story was well written to the point I cried at times.  I could feel the pain and angst the main character, Ana, was going through.  Ana doesnt reveal what happened in her past right away but there were enough hints that I was heartbroken for her.

I was rooting for Ana through the whole book and it was a complete rollercoaster for her (as well as for me!!).

I don't want to give anything away as to what happened with Ana but there is a huge cliffhanger at the end of the book. It was one of those that sucked the air out of my lungs because I couldn't believe what just happened.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"This might be my favorite celebrity memoir audiobook to date, simply because Martin Short is so freaking entertaining. On second thought, that's not the full reason why I loved this one...

While the narration performance was expectedly funny and entertaining (Short does a ton of impressions, including some of his most infamous charactersEd Grimley, Jiminy Glickas well as of his many celebrity friends, and he sings!), there were also some unexpectedly poignant and heart-wrenching moments captured too. Short spoke candidly about pretty much everything, and I have concluded that the man has the memory of an elephant because he was able to recall events and moments in his life dating back to his childhood with such pinpoint specificity, it was truly astonishing.

These read-by-the-author comedian celebrity memoirs have become my favorite things to listen to on audio. Even with the ridiculous name-dropping and chronology and details of things I don't remember or never even saw, I love how they give you both a performance and a real look inside the heart and soul of these entertainers.

If you are a casual fan of Martin Short, who I now feel like I know well enough to call ""Marty,"" treat yourself to I MUST SAY on audio. You won't regret it.

RATING: A-/B+ (4 stars)"

This is the first book of Larson's that I've read, and it officially made me a fan. His narrative style is smooth and entertaining. He was able to tell the story of a huge event using the little moments that better help us connect to history. Another great feature of this book was getting to understand what was happening not just on board the Lusitania, but also on U-20, the U-boat that sank her. Learning about that particular tour reinforces one of the themes of this account - that a million little things happened that led to the sinking. If just one of these many things had changed, on either side, the Lusitania would simply be the name of another ship from a bygone era.

Anyone interested in history, WWI, maritime history, U-boat history, or the politics of war will enjoy this book. It is extremely well written and just as important, accessible to the average reader.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I bought these in size 10.5 wide.  I normally wear size 11 wide sneakers, but these are a touch big.  No big deal.

They look very sharp!  I wear them with or without socks, with pants, with jeans, with shorts.  I live in NYC and walk everywhere, and these shoes are just so comfortable.

I have flat feet, so I can't wear shoes which have a pronounced hump in the insole.  The insole of these shoes is nice and flat, which I love, but you may not like that.

The grip is nice, too; I walked on some spilled water on a tile floor and didn't feel any slippage.

I plan on buying another pair in a different color to back these ones up.  The only thing stopping a 5-star review is that there are some rough edges on the inside, which can make them uncomfortable when wearing sock-less.  However, I'm finding those rough edges are smoothing out the more I wear the shoes, so we'll see!

UPDATE: The inside seams of the shoes really smoothed out after two weeks of wear (I wore short socks for the first two weeks). Now, the shoes are very comfy without socks as well!"
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"my 9 mo old cavapoo adores this toy. but his way of showing affection is to tear the trunk apart and chew the squirrels to death. No matter how many times I show him the proper way to play this intellectual toy, he insists on swinging the entire trunk wildly until the squirrels got shaken out. These 4 pieces, in total, lasted about a week, thus the reason for 3 stars."
Electronics_5,5.0,CG,"I've had the Bluesmart for a couple of years now and I'm still happy with the product. The other two have had problems. The first one is the plastic part. The second one is the plastic part. It's a little thin on the bottom but I don't feel it's going to get damaged.

I did get a free shipping label on the first one and the second one was great. The first one was defective and the second one is a good product. The second one is a little flimsy but I'm glad I got it for free. I just wish the first one had a more sturdy plastic part so I could try it out.

The only negative I can say is the shipping label does not cover the front of the box. I've had it for a while now and I have no problems with the shipping label. I will update this review when I receive it.

UPDATE: I received the product today. It has worked for a couple of weeks and the only problem I have is that the plastic part that came with it has a bad smell. The packaging was very very good and the packaging was very good. The packaging is very good and it's a good product. I have a nice white case and it's perfect.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"For the awesome price, this gets 5 stars. The battery life is amazing. I use them every day, and I probably charge them once a week. One thing you should be informed about: people keep breaking the charge port. I think this is because they are unnecessarily cramming the charger into the port. It's a tighter fit than any other micro USB, so just be gentle when plugging it in. I've not had a single problem."

This book is a must read for any young adult. It's very sad that this book is out of print. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery.I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading the next one in the series.

There is carpeting throughout most of the house, and on all 27 (sigh) stairs.  This thing got the stairs cleaner than I thought possible.  We've brought them back to looking brand new - not to mention the work it did on the furniture.  So, when I moved into a house with all hardwood floors but carpeted stairs (wait..what?), and two dogs...I knew what I had to do!  I have a Great Dane, and a Terrier style mutt.  Lots of blonde and white hair is attracted to those stairs.  This thing made them brand spanking new in minutes.  The suction is great - I am continually shocked that it is so powerful.  The front end tool is fantastic.  I can't say enough about this thing.  I highly recommend it!!"

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,CG,This is a deceptively simple book. The author has a good grasp on how to make a book. I had a lot of fun with this book. It was a very interesting read. It had a great story line and a good ending. I really enjoyed this book. The characters were strong and likable. I found myself rooting for the characters and I loved how they all made it through their lives.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Motion sensors are great for different areas around the house.  Couple of places we use them for are in the garage/storage rooms.  Basically a place you're going to go into often that you don't want to have to flip a light.  Works great when carrying something.  The other place that works well is a pantry/bathroom.

There are a couple of modes here that are nice, including the ambient mode which basically will not trigger if the room is already light enough, this is pretty great.  You can also trigger it on manually which is great if you know you are going to be in a room for awhile and are worried about the sensor picking you up (although this sensor is quite sensitive -- and has different settings for the size of the room).

Good price and one of those things that will make you smile every time you walk into a room with one."

They are very comfortable, very easy to put on, and very soft.  I have a wide foot and these shoes are perfect.  I do recommend these shoes.Love them!

I wear a size 8.5, and these fit perfectly. I will order a size 7, and they will fit. My only problem is that the fabric is thin, and the shoe is way too loose.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,Nice scope. It's not led sniper that's just the seller. It's just a generic scope. But it is nice and shipped fast. I wouldn't trust the rings but they look okay. Just not my type. I will update it once I field test it. Other than that it's very nice. Can't beat $60 . I'll change it to 5 stars once I use it and it works. (Update I shot it and it held zero through 20 rounds of .270 would recommend it to cheap hunters like myself also picked up the sun shade.(!!!!! UPDATE: I would not recommend this scope to anyone. It holds zero but when you go to use the focus on the back lens you can move the cross hairs all wich ways just by bumping it. Now I'm afraid my  scope isn't zerod. It is very blurry. It's okay for a first timer or if you don't touch the focus. But other than that it's a p.o.s also it doesn't catch light well.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"The Book of Illusions--being the story of the narrator's encounter with Hector Mann, a former silent filmmaker--presents quite a few passages where the narrator describes one of Mann's films.  As I was reading Auster's novel, I kept thinking I ought not to like the book so much.  After all, describing Mann's work seems patently second-hand--""telling"" in creative writing workshop language--and all the narrative commentary effectively takes interpretation out of readers' hands.  Yet, I could not put the book down.  The forthright prose and the resulting sincerity of the narrator won me over.  I didn't mind his being my eyes and ears.  Auster's movies seemed real.  While I didn't find myself watching the movies with him, he did make me want to watch them.  Narrators you care about can overcome any skepticism."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I believe there are more than enough reviews here to decifer whether or not you plan to read this  charming, witty and candid book. However, as an Australian raised in both Europe and America, I must heed a warning to those of you who read the negative reviews by Europeans and Asians. DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM!! They obviously lack a sense of humour and the ability to laugh at themselves (unlike Bryson).  Bryson can be provincial at times, but he is so charming indeed! One who has traveled for days in a foreign land can understand his exhaustion and frustration and will howl with laughter.
Yes, Bryson at times can be brutally honest with his opinion of foreign countries and their inhabitants and culture, but they are HIS OPINIONS and they are frankly FUNNY and quite observant. I suppose those who take offense to his opinions neglected to understand that Bryson is a brazen self critic  and will unabashedly admit to his lack of sophistication due to his stereotypical midwestern American upbringing. Please take no notice to the malevolence of the quazi-sensitive and humourless French and Germans who negatively reviewed this charming and engaging work.
Give the man a break and give this book a READ...Unless you possess absolutely no sense of humour, you will find it quite enjoyable!"

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"The company that supplied this ""used"" MBPr was extremely helpful. It wasn't really a used machine as far as I can tell. This came in the original box (more on that later) and shrunk wrapped.

When I placed the order, it wasn't supposed to arrive for 4-5 days. I contacted the seller and asked if they could please ship it quicker. I also mentioned I would pay whatever the additional charge would be. They replied quickly, had it delivered in two days (NY to NJ) and there was no additional charge.

I was thrilled. That is until I saw the laptop box. It was in bad shape. Not horrible, but one of the corners (and under the corner) was severely damaged. Crinkled and partially crushed. Enough so that it caused some concern about the laptops possible condition when I opened it. Turns out the laptop was in flawless condition, so no biggie. The box is still useable (although damaged) for eventual resale. I'm assuming the box was damaged BEFORE they sent it since the shipping box that contained the laptop and it's box was in great condition. Hmmm....

Anyway, it was listed as used, but there wasn't a scratch, ding or dent of any kind. Bottom line, I got a great machine with no damage for a great price with excellent customer service. No complaints. Just wish the laptop box wasn't damaged. That's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.

Highly recommend!!

Great experience overall."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"These are neither a good nor a bad glove; you just need to understand what you're ordering.  This is not a warm glove; it is a LINER, and a very thin, open weave liner at that.  You can see your hand through the loose weave, so you wouldn't wear these for principal cold weather protection for your hands.  They fit nicely and are comfortable with good finger length, and the biosensors work well on touch screens, although I don't understand why OR put biosensors only on the thumb and index fingers instead of on all the finger tips.  The glove is very flimsy and subject to pulls, runs, and catching on things, so I would not think them durable at all.  They also have scratchy tags sewn into the insides at the wrists, which tags are annoying and look difficult to remove.  Mine did not come with the clips shown in the photo (on Amazon) that hold the gloves together when not in use.  These gloves made me think about which fingers I use on my touchscreen, and I realized that I use more than just my thumbs and forefingers (I regularly use my middle finger) so for me this glove does not have enough biosensor tips.  I'm not wholly down on the gloves, but they are obviously really flimsy and apparently not intended to be warm."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Have you read this series? If no, start now! If yes, buy Hard Eight ASAP; fun reading lies ahead! Unlike Grafton's ""alphabet series"" which is getting formulaic and almost boring, Evanovich continues her ""number series"" at her high standard. Stephanie Plum continues to be a vitally inept bounty hunter. In this one she loses four (or is it five?) sets of handcuffs. She needs help bringing in one of her targets as he suffers from poor equilibrium: she cuffs him, he falls over, he's too fat to right himself--believe me, its laugh-out-loud funny. And, of course, Grandma Mazur continues her two favorite activities: ogling every man under seventy and haunting wakes to checkout the mortician's handiwork. Stephanie continues to be conflicted about her two men: the mysterious Ranger and cop Joe Moretti. Her stout heart and indefatigable manner finally pay off--you know they will--and the good guys triumph. Evanovich is a master of presenting a time and place: the Burg in New Jersey. Her humor is rampant and her characters are winning. Like I said: start or continue this series."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This novella is a very good addition to the Nemesis Unlimited series. Ada has been given an assignment to gather evidence against an aristocratic couple. This is her first real assignment for Nemesis, after helping them previously. She will be posing as a maid which is easy for her because she grew up in service. Nemesis has assigned her a partner for this mission. Ada only knows it is a man, posing as a footman. She only hopes it is not Michael who she worked with last time. Things got rather personal with Michael, and Ada was very hurt that she's never heard from him in the past six months after the mission.

Michael, who also grew up in service, specifically asked for this assignment so he could see Ada again. He is hoping that, in addition to getting the evidence they require, that perhaps things can start again with Ada.

I really liked how this whole novella pretty much took place ""below stairs"" from the servants' point of view. Michael and Ada have to sneak around constantly, even with the other servants, because if anyone suspects anything going on romantically between them, they'll get sacked. That helps build the romantic tension in the story. Recommended for readers who like the full-length Nemesis books."

I highly recommend it to anyone who needs one. This is a great tool for camping or backpacking. The mount is very secure, and it is well built. This tool is super lightweight and lightweight. I have used it a couple of times in the field and it is very easy to use and to assemble. It does work well for the purpose it is intended for, but for the price, I would definitely recommend it. I'm happy with my purchase. Works great on my Trek SRAM Touring Handgun. I used this for the first time this summer and it worked very well."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I've been very pleased with these leggings. I'm 5'11"" and usually a L/XL size that says it will fit me, does not.  I was very impressed that these DID fit. They ended about 3 inches above my ankles, but could be pulled lower, resulting in a thinner, stretched legging.
 I was also impressed with how versatile the sizing can be for these because of the elastic waistband and stretchy fleece. These are true to the claim that they do not contain a seam.  The inside is a very soft, low pile fleece material. The outside is smoother, not furry.  The elastic waistband is incorporated INTO the fabric, so the waist is VERY comfortable and not bulky at all. These keep my legs warm in the winter and pair nicely with a boot.
I have noticed that when something rubs against them in the same place over and over, they can get little fuzz balls. They also attract animal hair like crazy. If you have pets you will probably become frustrated with this. However, I've noticed that this is common with ALL fleece leggings so I am not removing a star for it - only letting other customer's know what to expect.

I have a portable light that I can use for a walk or bike ride. I just put it on my car and it works great. I have two of these on my phone. I've used the light for a couple of months now and it's just fine. I've found that it is really bright and it's very useful. It's not a full size light, but it's nice to have something that's more light than I've had before. I also like that the battery is made of metal and I can recharge it quickly. I recommend this light to anyone who is looking for a rechargeable flashlight. I've had mine for a couple of months now and it's very bright. I've seen some reviews that said it would be more expensive than a standard compact flashlight. But it's not. I don't have any flashlights that cost more than this one, so it's not a great deal for a small flashlight.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,I bought this cage for my Holland lop. Fantastic size for him with lots of extra room for him to play.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This is an excellent head lamp, Vitchelo has out done themselves. A little warning to any potential buyers of the Vitchelo V600 Plus. This doesn't work the same as the regular V600. The up side of this fact; this is the first headlamp flashlight with a dimming feature. I highly recommend reading, and understanding the directions for these headlamps by Vitchelo.
  Shipping was very prompt, only two days. The headlamp comes in a nifty leather pouch, another first for a headlamp. And the batteries provided are Duracell Copper Top. Not some cheap off brand batteries, often provided in new flashlights.
  In the purchase of my last Vitchelo head lamp, I wasn't sure how water, and weather proof this product achieves. I'm happy to say; the Vtchelo
V 600 exceeded my expectations in keeping out all water. My Vitchelo V600 is also very rugged. After 6 months of being strapped to my hard hat, as I work on all sorts of cranes. My V600 has taken many hard bumps; I've onIy replaced the batteries twice, and my quality head lamp keeps working and working. I'm very impressed with the Vitchelo product line. I know this same standard of quality will carry over into my Vitchelo V600 Plus.
  I've also ordered the Vitchelo flashlight lantern, and hammock strap products. Although my delivery has been delayed, I'm highly anticipating the arrival of my new products by Vitchelo.
The Vitchelo V600 Plus headlamp; a great headlamp at a truly competitive price!"

There is no way I want to pick up on the story several months from now to see what happened. If it were available now, I probably would have purchased the 2nd in the series but most probably will not purchase now....who knows when the third one will be available?

Wyatt is the oldest son of Joe and Cassidy Black. He has been deemed the heartbreaker, by many and he hates that title. Wyatt is looking for something special he just doesn't know what that special is until he see Nellie. Nellie has come back home to California, but she is also running away from the trouble she left back in Seattle. The trouble is not of her making, but of the crazy ex-boyfriend who didn't know much about Nellie as he thought that she did. When Wyatt first lays eyes on Nellie, he wants to lay not just eyes, but hands, mouth and body. Can Wyatt overcome his ""Heartbreaker"" stigma and win Nellie mind, body and soul? or will this heartbreaker become one of the broken hearted?

This book had me laughing, crying and wanting a Wyatt. I would recommend this book to anyone who love a good alpha male with a heart of gold story. Can't wait to read more of the Brothers Black."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Censorship and moral codes took the bite out of screwball comedy as the 1930s progressed, but in the 1940s such directors as Howard Hawks and Preston Sturges found ways to revive the genre in very high style.  Not only is THE LADY EVE one of Sturge's best, it is also one of the finest in the entire genre, a comedy so potent that even the most jaded will be completely charmed.
There is no way to describe the story without spoiling the fun, so suffice to say the plot concerns the heir to a fortune (Fonda)who is beset by a beautiful but predatory card shark (Stanwyck)--and who looses considerably more than his heart in the process. Considered racy for its time, Stanwyck's... manipulation of Fonda is one of the funniest elements of the film, and the movie as a whole abounds with ""Garden of Eden"" motifs: the name Eve, apples, and (of course) a snake.  Everything moves along at a fast pace and with plenty of crackle, so there's never a dull moment, and the exceptional supporting cast includes witty performances from Charles Coburn, Eugene Pallette, William Demarest, Eric Blore, and a host of others. It would be hard to imagine any one who wouldn't enjoy seeing this film at least once--and like the best films, THE LADY EVE does not give up all her secrets in one whack. The story and performances bear up under repeated viewings.  Comedy fans will enjoy it again and again!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"Only needing a CO detector in one room, I don't think these combo CO/smoke detectors are a very good idea.  (Maybe if I needed a lot of CO detectors I would, however.)  Make sure you save the directions, as well as memorize how many horn beeps there are for smoke and how many there are for carbon monoxide.  Also, the directions make it seem like there is a smoke LED and a CO LED, when there is only one for both.  In addition, you are not suppose to need to replace the batteries during the 10-year-life of the detector, since it has ""sealed, ten year lithium batteries"", yet the directions state there is a ""low battery chirp"" and tells you to install ""2 new AA batteries"" if that chirping happens?!  (Can you or can you not replace the batteries without deactivating the detector?)  Moreover, if you end up having to deactivate the detector for any reason, it becomes that week's trash.  (Only, you can't throw it in the trash.)  Finally, the directions say to test the detector once a week!  (Yeah, sure, especially if you have a lot of them.)  I don't think 10-year detectors are a good idea at all.  If you are required by law to have them, my sympathy to you.  For anyone wanting a CO detector by itself, I highly recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Alert-CO615-Dual-Power-Carbon-Monoxide-Plug-In-Alarm-with-Battery-Backup-and-Digital-Display/dp/B000Q5VMKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Alert CO615 Dual Power Carbon Monoxide Plug-In Alarm with Battery Backup and Digital Display</a>, and there are plenty of decent smoke detectors out there that don't last 10 years.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"We got this as an upgrade to our current Sentry Fire-Safe which is older (circa 2000), smaller, and doesn't have a water rating. At first feel, the dial felt a bit cheap and clunky as it didn't spin smoothly (it was like you could feel it catch every so often) but it didn't hamper the use of the safe at all. I'm not sure if I love or hate the clicking sounds as you rotate the dial (my last one was silent so am used to that). I hope to never worry about needing to unlock it in a perfectly quiet manner.

Regarding the keys, I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about--you don't NEED the keys to lock the safe. I locked mine just fine without the key: just close the safe, raise the lever, and spin the dial...and it's locked. The key just adds another layer of security--once you lock the safe with the dial, you use the key to turn the key-lock from Unlocked to Locked. But, thinking I might have missed something (after reading a few reviews) I just specifically went back to test it...and confirmed you do not need the key to securely lock the safe. Right now, my keys are locked in the safe and I can get in and out just fine.

I do like all the room in the safe, but would have liked a drawer (like the one that came with my other safe) or at least another shelf. I was also blessed with a super easy combination, so I'm thrilled with that.

Overall, a very nice safe for the price."

The elevator still doesn't work right.  The cords on both elevators are an inch too short to actually go through the guides, and the clip holding it on at the top comes off every time it is used.  I assume this is a problem with every unit since two units 3 years apart had the problem.

The new hottub doesn't light up like the old one did.  But this isn't a big deal.

The assembly takes about 20 minutes if you are adept at putting things together and reading VERY POOR instructions.  I have assembled thousands of things from toys to furniture to things at work and these are sub-par.  The only real complaint is the sheet of stickers which you have to put on in a very exacting way and which should have been factory applied.  There is no excuse for not simply having the machines that built the house do this step and it means that most of us will have imperfect looking finished products.

For fun I would give this product many stars.  The kids enjoy playing with it. It is big, pink, has Barbie and fits Barbie sized dolls.  I would recommend this overall but know that it is not quite as sturdy as it can be."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"Got this product to do our upstairs (only area that is carpeted in our home). Ordered on sale, and got the item promptly through Amazon. Fast forward to 4 months later (we never took it out of the box) and opened it to get to work since we were expecting company. Instructions were horrendous, but finally got the thing put together. My husband and I couldn't figure out why the vac was not standing upright on its own, but kept falling backwards. Figured something must be missing and/or not put together properly. We dumped the Hoover box upside down in an effort to see if there were any missed parts and the only thing that fell out was a teeeeennnnyyyy tiny piece of plastic (think size of a marble). Turns out that little piece of plastic had a big job-it held up the ENTIRE machine. A bit stunned that some genius thought plastic would be good to use for such a crucial part of the machine, I called Hoover expecting them to stand behind their ""One Year Warranty"" that the machine came with. Explained the situation to a Hoover rep who assured me that we could take it to an authorized Hoover store for free repair. I was also confident since the machine was not even used once that the Hoover store could verify that clearly this had not been our fault. Wrong again. We got a phone call 2 days later informing us that the plastic piece that was broken was NOT covered under warranty and it would cost $120.00 to fix. ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?? Oh yes, let's pay for a piece of (*#&(W*#&( machine twice. I think not. This has been the worst experience and I will NEVER purchase anything Hoover again. Cheap plastic, poor design, horrible customer service. Lesson learned the hard way, hope others can learn from our mistake. What a joke!!!! Hoover gets a F- in my book."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,2.0,OR,"I love bamboo.  I am picky about what goes into my kitchen or, as in this case, what I give to someone else for their kitchen.  I read all the reviews (on Amazon and on other sites) about Joyce Chen and took a chance.  Big mistake.  Compared to my other bamboo utensils, these are cheap and what I would consider to be disposable.  They are not what I would call ""burnished"" by any means.  The product description uses words like ""beautiful and practical"" and ""impressive"" to describe Joyce Chen tools.  I wouldn't even think those words in connection with the utensils I received.  The surface was rough and uneven, and one item even had visible ""splinters"" on it.  It will only take a few minutes to sand them down and oil them to make decent (not wonderful) utensils, but I am disappointed that I will have to do so.  I would not want to wash these until I sand and oil them.  I think the water would get in and cause them to spit.  Of course, I ignored my own rule... you get what you pay for... and that's what I get.  Next time, I will pay more and get Totally Bamboo products."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Holy COW!  IT WORKS!!!  Nothing sticks to Tarps, EVER, and it never ever lasts, but someone made a deal for their soul and behold!  We have TARP TAPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Truthfully, here is my story.

I like Burning Man because the climate tries to kill you (and other reasons.)  A HUGE, CRAZY STORM CAME AND FILLETED MY SHELTER!!  It struck from three directions and damaged every single tent in its vicinity, toppled pop-up campers and shredded the mylar off the tarp base in my roof.  It knocked over entire rows of porta-potties and left me sleeping in my car for days because it filled my shelter with mud and the roof (a tarp) was split.

My conundrum was severe.  The restoration was going to have to happen, should I ever not sleep in my car again, and so I evaluated the tarp tape and hoped it would do the job.  I did a sloppy job of cleaning off the surfaces and I started reattaching the mylar to the tarp with the tarp tape.  I used sutures and long stretches of tape to repair the splits and make the roof look like a relative of Frankenstein.  I didn't think it would last one day, but it survived for two weeks in the desert, through another rain storm and many hot days.  It didn't peel.  It didn't bubble up under the sun or slide like some tapes will when they overheat.  It just held strong.

I'm in love."

The game itself is very simple, you just have to say ""go"" and ""go"" in a few sentences. If you're looking for something fun for the kids, this is a must!  Highly recommended. I ordered this to add to my collection of awesome figures for my son's birthday party. The figure was very well made and very well made. He loved it. The face looks really nice and he enjoys playing with it. He loved it and put it together. The face is very soft and cuddly and I like that it is made of a soft material. It is cute.

The zip up pockets on the waste belt are very handy, maps, small binoculars, multi tool etc. seems very well made. I use the shelf for for sleeping bag however, the pack has a sleeping bag compartment. It is basically a pack inside a pack with drawstrings at the top and bottom. If you use the shelf for your bag you can access everything from the bottom. I replaced the the round key ring type things that the pack is attached with with cotter type pins but I understand their idea behind the rings. They are a little quieter.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I think I own about 10 pair of Cushe shoes, probably more. They are about the only brand of casual shoes I wear. I happened to find some by accident, and it took all of about 2 hours to break them in and for them to mold perfectly to my foot. Cushe shoes are the ultimate comfort and support. My feet never tire in them. I used to wear different brands all of the time, but I don't see any need to shop around for comfort since I found Cushe. There are enough styles to cover many looks. If you have not tried them and want a super comfortable shoe, obviously since I have 10 pair I'm sold on them.
Only reason for 4 stars. The shoes I received do NOT have the type of laces shown, which was a major factor in deciding to buy this shoe. I have another pair in a different color that does have the shown lace, and I like them much better. I'm a bit disappointed because the laces shown look better and you don't have to mess with tying them. I will probably write the seller and ask if they can send me the laces shown. But, it's not really worth the hassle of retuning the shoes. If Cushe wasn't such a great product I would have slammed this, but I just can't!"

Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"Well, it just came in the mail and I was so excited (my 7 months old adopted dog is a mad chewer, particularly on cords) that I opened it immediately and began to put it on my iPad cord. I carefully put it in and squeezed it shut to be sure no actual cord was exposed. It stunk like mad, but I figured that would die down and at least my cords weren't being destroyed - heck, if I had to I could charge it in another room, right? I had the 10 foot size open because it's a long cord, so only a small piece had to be trimmed. My fingers are reeking by now, and I'm about to eat lunch, but hey, the dog won't chew on it, right? I deliberately left the cord on the floor while I went to make my lunch, peeking in on the puppy. Stayed away completely, so I couldn't tell if it would deter. Went in to eat (or try to, it really smelled fresh out of the package) and the puppy was sitting off to the side, behaving himself, so...... WAIT! What's that. He's chewing on the small piece of cord protector I cut off. And as I watched to see if it bothered him at all, he continued to worry it and chew.
Maybe this stuff works on some dogs. I'm going to have to try the bitter Apple repellant spray I bought along with this and hope for the best. Sure wish I hadn't gotten 2 packs of each size though. With that smell, and the poor results, no way I'm using it."

Seems put together well; the boots have a little Velcro strap to try and keep them down around the shoe. The outfit was easy for him to put on; the cape comes off for easy changing and he had a little wiggle room so he can wear some long underwear or thermals under it when we go out trick-or-treating. The mask fits perfect as well; there are little cushions in the mask so the plastic isn't right on his face. So far, very good buy; cheap and fits him perfectly."

You read about Michael Moore and Noam Chomsky, who just flat out hate the way America is and praise socialism. You read about the head of the NAACP who keeps telling blacks they are victims. I don't agree with everyone on the list, but it is interesting reading. There are a few conservatives on the list too. Michael Savage is on the list and deserves to be. He is one of the most crude and vile humans alive. I really wouldn't call Savage a conservative though, that is just what liberals call him."

I also think it's a good idea to have a few extra boots in your home.  This is not a big deal for us, because it's a very inexpensive toy.  But I would be disappointed if they included a few extra boots for the price.

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"I have mixed feelings about this book.  At times I loved it; other times I threw it across the room.  The information on writing reviews, Listmania, and So You'd Like To...Guides was extremely valuable.  Knowing how Amazon uses this information to get more exposure for your book is worth the price of the book.

But there were a lot of questions that remained unanswered.  Author Connect was somewhat confusing.  I asked quite a few people to access an author's profile page and no one succeeded. Amazon customers will follow the path of least resistance. If these are so well hidden that Brent has to give you a web address to put in to find it, how are the readers supposed to uncover this ""useful"" information?  They won't.  I understand that isn't the Brent's fault, but why should I spend my time doing something potential buyers can't find, even if it's free!

Buy X Get Y could have been more detailed.  There is more to pairing books than selecting a title.  Is it worthwhile to pair your book with a top selling title that has a one or a two-star review as a Spotlight Review?  What if the title you select is in the top 10 in sales, but sells for 1/2 the price of yours?  Is it a good match?  I don't expect Brent to do all the work, but I do feel these are valid questions that should have been addressed.

If you look at most of the 5 star reviews, you will see that they are nothing more than shameless self-promotions of books written by the reviewers.  That should tell you something."

How Viewsonic managed to so badly mangle the operating system is beyond me. But...spend just a couple minutes on the xda forums to find the instructions for how to root, spend another couple of minutes performing the root and ROM installation (and, for extra credit, install the Pershoot kernel), and you'll have a tablet that is lightening quick and capable.

But that's only because the Android OS is still transforming from it's caterpillar form into the beautiful butterfly it will become. You'll trade ""pretty"" for ""powerful"" since a rooted tablet like this one will give you full access to all of the amazing (and often experimental) apps in the Android Market.

Another ding: accessories. I picked up the USB keyboard/case for this device on amazon (for about $25) and love it. It adds amazing functionality with complete plug-and-play ability. But...that's about the *only* case you'll find for it besides the generic sleeves for 10"" tablets (I also got one of those).

I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the dreaded poor viewing angle for the screen often annoys me. It's true that you could potentially claim this is a ""privacy"" feature, but don't be fooled. I've often had to tweak the angle to get a comfortable non-eye-strain producing view of the screen for long periods.

Lastly, the front-facing camera (the only one) stinks. But, at a price half to a third of similar tablets on the market, I'm OK with that and the other limitations I mentioned."

1. The USB port on the back is a little too short for the Apple iPad Mini, the plastic part on the front is too long for my iPad Mini, and the back of the iPad Mini is too long for the USB port on the front.

UPDATE 11/3/15: Dropping this down to two stars.  After only a few months of ownership the simple soldering joints where the vertical poles attach to the base broke.  This holder is decorative.

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"This film reminded of ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle."" George Harriman (Lou Felder) a poorly developed character has been terminated from his fictional movie company for embezzling and to top it all off he might go to prison. Like any white collar criminal faced with ""hard"" time in a federal pen, he opts to do the honorable thing and shoot his family and himself...except for some reason he omits his daughter who is a nurse (Lisa Zane as Laura Harriman ).

When George's former boss Bob (Michael Fairman) hears about it he goes catatonic, like Ned seeing the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka (South Park season 2). Laura assumes a new identity to infiltrate the home as a nurse so she can bump off Bob's family in front of him.

The terror and acting were both lame. Except for the rare F-bomb, this could have been a made for TV movie. Perhaps my biggest disappointment was right after I obtained this film I discovered it was available in a multi-film pack for the same price.

Rare F-bomb, no sex or nudity. What this movie really needed was for Demi Moore to play the lead with a token shower scene and a little more success and creativity in killing off relatives."

I will work on it at home where we have more time to spend trying to set it up and I will update this post if I can get it to work.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I'm pretty impressed with this litter trap mat. The material is spongy and soft for the cat to walk on and it's big enough to cover the entrance to our litter box while still providing a lot of cover on either side and in front so the cat can't just jump over it on the way out. The spacing of the material is wide enough so that it really can be vacuumed and shaken out (the previous litter trap mat we had was made from a similar material but once litter got in there it was very hard to get out even after vigorous shaking or vacuuming). It's also a little thicker so that it doesn't feel flimsy. I've had some half-circle litter trap mats and they seemed like a good idea but left too much space on the sides of the entrance. This one covers everything. I really like this thing. Some reviewers mentioned a strong plastic smell when opening this and that's true but it's not a big deal. It's a mat that sits outside your cat's litter box, so plastic odor is not a big deal.

It's definitely not perfect and doesn't catch all litter, but with good positioning it captures most and that perfect product that does it all hasn't been invented yet."

-Cool color (traditional red's nice, but kinda boring).

I like the other features as well: tweezers, awl/punch, can opener, and parcel hook which I use for pulling tent stakes.

Excellent quality, nice features, nice price. It's got enough tools to be useful in most situations, yet small enough to carry in larger pockets.

************************************
UPDATE 4/6/15:
Since this review I have collected several dozen more SAK's. I just love them. I have decided that I prefer the Climber models over the Super Tinker for the following reasons:

-The Super Tinker's Phillips driver is in an awkward location (in the middle of the knife rather than the end).
-The Phillips on the Super Tinker is redundant because the Can Opener suffices quite well as a Phillips driver.
-Replacing the Super Tinker's Phillips driver with the Corkscrew and concealed Mini Driver adds two extra tools to the same compact design.

Regardless, I still do love the Super Tinker. But I feel there's a little more functionality in the Climber."

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"The Project Mc2 Soda Pop Science Kit comes with a kit to make your own fizzy soda.

You can make:

Lime Soda
Cinnamon Soda (didnt taste this!)
Fruit Punch

Kit includes:
Critic Acid
Baking Soda
Flavor packages
Test Tubes
Stand for the test tubes
Measuring Scoops
Instruction Booklet

This is a fun kit for kids. They market the MC2 line to promote science to girls and I appreciate that. I don't know if I was that hip on making soda - but we gave it a try.

The instructions are easy to follow, you add a few ingredients and make a drink. It really wasn't that hard. It was cool that you could have these things lying around and make your own later and they get the concept of household DIY stuff - that would normally be packaged and sold.

Overall, this was a basic science toy and for about the age range of 8 years of age."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"To date, I have read Nikki's Secret, Text Message and Scrapping the Bone and I have to tell you, William Malmborg delivers. His stories are not for meek, but they are not so far out there that people will be offended or put off by reading them. What I love about Malmborg's work is that it is a little racey, a little raunchy and a whole lot of fun. The story lines flow. Once you start reading, you cannot stop. It's like opening up a huge bag of Dorito's and saying ""I'll just have a few"". Can't do it. You dive into one of his books and you will be reading until 4 am just to see what the heck Nikki's Secret is, or how is Mallory going to walk into that men's bathroom and do that thing? You just have to find out. Each book is a decadent pleasure, a pure delight that you can sink your teeth into and get lost in the process.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I have 3 sets of these gloves... two of the prevouos model with the criss cross velcro strips and one of the newer rubber strips.
I find the older model gave better support and position of the knuckes was aided from the tightening of the strips.
Are they better than handwraps? if you use cheap practice gloves, yes. Specially if your hands get sore easily.
but beware that they don't offer very strong wrist support, unless you really tighten them.
the stiching on one of them has come undone, but note that is probably from choosing a wrong size... if they are not snug enough and move around inside the gloves that maight be the case... I have two L mand an Xl the Xl has had the stichting come undone.
Not that it matters much... these suckers are for punching.  I have recently traded my cheap Everlast practice gloves for Title's Fighting brand sparring gloves. Perhaps I will go with wraps again.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"My late husband and I received this as a wedding gift in 2003. This coffee maker will grind beans, then brew, or you can just put ground coffee in it. For the most part, I just use ground coffee, but on occasion I'll buy whole bean coffee, and it works great. Some other reviewers have said that the grinding mechanism is loud, but I have a separate grinder, and it's no louder than that.

If you don't want to grind, just brew, there is a ""grind off"" button that you push before turning it on, and it just brews, without grinding- easy.

You can set it to make coffee at a pre-set time, and I've never had a problem with this- it's easy to set.

The coffee is brewed into a thermal carafe, and this works GREAT- my late husband would often get up around 6 am and brew a full pot. By the time I woke up at 8:30, it was still steaming hot, and no burned coffee from an under carafe heater.

The unit looks great and doesn't take up too much space on my counter.

The interior pieces come apart (basket, piece that holds the basket), and are easily washed in the top rack of the dishwasher.

Some people have complained in these reviews that they don't like the plastic insides, but I've had this machine for 4 years, and there's been no problem with anything breaking or malfunctioning in any way. There is also a mesh basket, which you can use as a filter, but if you remove it, you can  place a regular paper coffee filter in it's place.

I love that at parties, or on a nice day outside, I can place the carafe right on the table, and the coffee will stay hot for a long, long time.

I've had this machine for 4 years, and have been very happy with it. I've purchased several of them as gifts for people, as well- and everyone has loved it."

Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"I can't fathom how the glowing reviews on this product could possibly be real. I just received mine yesterday, just in time to pick my cat up from the vet, after having surgery.

I live in New York City so I don't have a car, and probably wheel it around more than most people will. The shoulder straps for the carrier can't be removed. When you wheel this carrier around, the straps get caught in the wheels. After wheeling it around for 6 blocks, the straps were literally shredded.

The clasps for the removable shoulder strap is made of VERY cheap plastic, rather than metal so you have to be very careful with it, otherwise the plastic will snap.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"I initially mounted this scope on my AR, and have used it in about half a dozen outings. I found that I was really fighting with it, usually spending a good amount of ammo on constantly sighting and fixing. I will say, it is what it is, an under $100 scope, that I attempted on a .223 platform. There are hundreds of reviewers here that have been happy with this setup on an AR, but it just didn't work for my use (150 yards or less, mostly 100). When it was on, it was on. It just never stayed. You really need to have a strong understanding of MOA, scope centering and sighting, field of view, point of impact, etc, but especially with the cheaper scopes, as the adjustments will be crude and course. With higher end optics, the settings and adjustments are smooth and precise. I was able to mount this to my son's 10/22, and hopefully that will be an appropriate application. So if you are considering this for an AR, (just my 2 cents), there are plenty of lower cost options available slightly above the low end UTG products that offer much more."

Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"I bought this for my Windows 7 Desktop PC.  I was tired of running a cord from my router in the bedroom to the living room where the PC resides.  I have a Linksys e3000 Router which is a top of the line router.  I wanted a wireless USB device which would allow me to have a full 300MB/s connection.  This one fit the bill and was reasonably priced so I went with it.  After downloading the right drivers from the web I was set to go.  Unfortunately, I could not get a connection higher than 130MB/s.  It seems this device will only work at the full 300MB/S on the 2.4GHz band (not the 5GHz band) and only at the wider channel widths.  I set my router up this way but this would still not pick up at the full 300MB/s.

This would have been bad but not a deal breaker.  But then the device would not keep a stable connection.  It would keep dropping the connection despite the fact that the router was working just fine.  Confirmed this by using my iPad, iPhone, and my Windows laptop to connect to my router every time the connection went down.  They all worked fine.

I did need one because I have a large soaker tub with a wide rim and a wall mounted faucet. It was really tough to find a long wall mounted spout that wasn't really expensive. I also wanted one without a diverter, but that just wasn't going to happen, so I settled on this one and just removed the diverter. The spout itself is pretty solid and installation was easy. You can install it in three ways: 1) with a short MPT stub, 2) with a long MTP stub, or 3) with a o-ring-sealed slip fit. My only complaint is that the quality of the finish is not great. There are visible cross-hatch marks in the finish. It's not scratched (if it was I would have returned it for a replacement). It appears to be just the way these are made - the metal is not getting polished to a sufficient degree. Unless you're a perfectionist like me, this probably won't bother you, but I wanted to mention it."

I highly recommend it.It was a pleasant read. I am now reading it again.This is a great book for a weekend or for a weekend for a family.

I suppose there is a possibility that Simpson did confess. It simply seems to me that given that the author admits to having made up stories about Simpson in the past, the credibility of this interview is questionable. The book is well written, and for that , I'll give it 3 stars. I'm sorry I couldn't give it more, and I don't necessarily believe that Simpson is innocent. I simply question the veracity of the story based on information given by the author himself. Ultimately, I can neither encourage nor discourage the reader.

Nonetheless, I'm pleased to be able to purchase these in bulk. I was worried one can would run out in the middle of cleaning my computer fans (the main purpose I made this purchase), so I figured it would be best if I had extra at hand. The instructions are quite clear on the bottle--no shaking of the product before or after use, can will get cold throughout duration of use, be careful not to be in direct contact of the compressed air as it can cause frost bite, etc.

Lastly, every single can--and I received four just as pictured on the product description--has their own red tube for hard to reach places. One can was also sufficient in cleaning up my macbook pro computer fans with plenty of air to spare!"

I've had to replace the battery in one of the original remotes. It's a bit difficult to get the case open to replace the battery, but they last for around 5 years which seems pretty reasonable. The only indication that the battery was failing was a reduction in the operating range of the remote. Programming the remote is very simple (directions are provided with the unit), and it's nice to be able to use several remotes with both garage doors. The removable clip is nice, too, allowing you to carry the remote in a pocket with no sharp edges. Just remember: if you put the remote in your motorcycle jacket, zip it up before you go for a ride (see previous comment about a lost unit)."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,We gave up on this one about 30-minutes in because it was billed as a comedy and we didn't find it humorous and the woman doing the documentary was too hard on the eyes. We came back to it a few weeks later and it got much better though the hair and face on the woman doing the documentary didn't get any better. The way Leslie sets up his night of murder is worth the price of admission and it explains almost every horror movie that has a group of people in a place where they will be killed off one by one. There is some humor in it and its a dark comedy that Im glad I didn't totally give up on.

Duke has returned to town to visit his aunt in the hospital only to run into the one woman he cannot forget.  Grace is dealing with her sick father and a secret that she has kept from Duke.  When the secret is revealed everything changes.  This was a great romance with a few twists.  The connection between Duke and Grace started years ago and is still vibrant as before.  This story unfolded like a mystery with images of the past and questions about a future.  I enjoyed reading this story and look forward to more in the series.

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"As you all know, when Im reviewing a book Im big on storyline, character development and connection not only between the characters, but connecting with the book as well.

As far as sexual chemistry, Sky and Ford had it in spades. Every time they looked at one another they were either undressing each other with their eyes or bumping uglies like Jack rabbits. This book definitely didn't lack in the sex department. You were left with nothing less than pure blissful satisfaction, definitely no problem there.

Though Sky and Ford got off on the wrong foot in the beginning, you were able to see how there could be a connection between them once they started opening up to each other and realized they had quite a bit in common. I felt a bit torn because for me, their connection felt more rushed than natural.

Sadly that is kind of how I felt about Repair Me overall. The storyline was good but too much was happening too fast. Every time I would start to connect with the book and really get into it, another scenario was thrown at me to deal with but there wasn't enough time before the book ended for it to feel natural. Either the book needed to be longer or some of the situations needed to be left out in order for the story to develop naturally and really be able to sink your teeth into the book.

I believe this series has potential and I am curious to see what Jennifer does with book 2"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I don't have sleep apnea, but I sometimes snore at night. In addition to using nasal strips, I purchased this made-in-America SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW to help cut down on my snoring. As the name suggests, this pillow isn't a traditional shaped pillow and is contoured. Depending on how you place the pillow, one of the bumps is larger than the other one. This is not a full gel pillow or a full memory foam pillow. Instead, this pillow is mostly composed of memory foam that is covered in a layer of gel foam.

I have used this pillow for about six months. It has helped cut down on the snoring I do at night. In terms of comfort, the SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW is usually a pretty comfortable pillow. However, occasionally there are times when I find the contour shape to be uncomfortable, such as when I was sick or when I have had a very busy and stressful day at work and my neck is already sore.

Hard to put down, this laugh-out-loud-until-tears-run-down-your-face book has a character that somehow manages to survive dead bodies, bad hair, dead bodies, her grandmother, bombs, a healthy libido, and more dead bodies as she searches for local favorite turned fugitive Uncle Mo. Even better than the first two in this series. Very fun to read."

It allowed me to turn my rig around in places I would not dare to do with out this camera, as it was to dangerous for the rig and anyone to go out to guide me back. The camera is a fish eye, so mounted at a 45 degree angle, I can see the whole back of my camper, and up into the sky, and several car widths to both sides of the back of my camper.  I was also amazed at how you can adjust the guide lines to fit your rig, raise them up, down, and spread them apart or closer together so they perfectly fit your use.  If want, you can remove the guide lines with a simple checkmark in my GPS, but with being able to adjust them so much, I would not know why anyone would want to turn them off.

I thought I'd be getting a great deal, since my previous experience with reconditioned / refurbished products has been uniformly good. Not so here. The coffee maker came missing several parts, including the espresso carafe and the metal filter basket. Foolishly, I decided that it wasn't worth returning the whole item to Amazon for these two small parts, but as it turned out, these two small parts were impossible to find online. I eventually managed a partial solution, but then I encountered a much bigger challenge (at least when it comes to enjoying a nice cappuccino). On other machines I've had, the steam pressure could be directed either toward the filter basket or into the milk frother. Not so here. The steam isn't emitted through the frothing tube until practically the end of the process. So, great espresso but crappy cappuccino because the milk never gets warm and never gets frothy.

It took a few extra days because of the holiday but I had the new necklace a week later.  Only bummer is that since it was a Christmas gift I had to wait weeks to get it to my niece since they wouldnt allow me to have the necklace shipped to an address other than the original shipping address.

After one visit to the vet, we were told that Greenies are made predominantly of wheat and that could lead to problems in the later years.  We were giving him at least two a day.  She recommended giving him one maybe every other day or on special occasions.  So the hunt began...

We've tried all kinds.

Of all of them, Greenies are his favorites.  They're also the cheapest.

The size of these are a little larger than the Greenies.  They're also pretty cheap on Amazon compared to a local pet store.  They do seem a little tougher than the other dental chews.  All of the other ones seem a bit softer, but these are a bit rough and harder.  One thing that we liked about them is that they are wheat free and gluten free.  Our dog seems to like them.

We try to mix it up and give him different treats throughout the week.  These are a good treat to throw in the mix if you'd like to do that.  They're no Greenies, but if it will keep our little guy healthier a little longer, then we'll continue to give him these and spoil him at the same time."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Pros:
Casters can be removed and stored within the bottom of the unit, securely for storage.
Cord has storage compartment with a closing door, which latches securely.
Four Heat settings.
Silent.
Highly Effective.

Cons:
Documentation is a little dated, refers to the switches on the unit being a rotary type dial control.

While the product description does mention a circulation fan, I don't see one - and frankly I'm glad it doesn't seem to have one.  It's silent, totally silent.  Setting switch 3 (Bottom Element) to ON (375 Watts), more than ample to heat my entire upstairs.  A pleasant slow event heat.

The product isn't UL listed, but it is ETL listed.  There is an overheat circuit interrupt with a button on the back of the unit, and sensitive tip over cut-off switch.  Very pleased with the safety of the unit overall.

The unit functions in two ways, first is the reflective heat you can see and feel when the unit is ON; it feels like warm sunshine.  Second, it functions as a convection heater; air passes through from the cold floor up through the unit and is released via a grill on the top of the unit.

Switch Layout:
Switch 3 - Bottom Element
Switch 2 - Top Two Elements
Switch 1 - Second From Bottom Element

Dial:
No temperature markings, does have a very wide travel path; so accurate temperature control is very easy.

Most heaters of this type are two settings only, ~1000 Watt, and ~1500 Watt.  This results in good warmth, but results in the area in front of the unit being warmer than the rest of the room.

When I purchased, there were only two reviews on this unit.  One review was particularly harsh and gave a One-Star due to the misprint about the fan. I decided to take the plunge and buy the heater anyway; very glad for my decision to buy."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I was pleasantly surprised by this little gem! I ordered it and watched it because I had read some of the more positive reviews and also because I seem to ""share"" my taste in movies with a few other customers so I always look at what they said, first, and if they like and/or love it, I usually do, as well! I don't want to name names because for all I know, they may HATE my reviews!
But, all kidding aside, this is a good movie. The actors were good, the writers were good; I guess almost everyone involved in getting this film out did a good job! The plot was creative and interesting and while I DID guess some of the outcomes, the ending came out of nowhere and really blew me away! I was NOT expecting that one and that's one of the things I love in a movie. Movies should be entertaining, have a good plot, have good actors (even if they're not well known), good direction and keep you interested from the first frame to the last and sometimes even give the viewer a great surprise they weren't expecting at all. This movie did all of that. I'd definitely recommend it and think it's worth both your time and your money."

It also has the zoom feature that I had a few years ago, so I have to keep it on my camera while I shoot in the field.  I really like the fact that the camera will automatically turn off when the lens is fully charged.  It's a great little camera, but I'm a big fan of the Nikon DX-SLR.  I was very excited when I saw that the camera would have a menu on it for setting it up, but the menu was not very clear.  I also got the auto-focus feature.  It's a nice feature, but I found that it was too obvious to use.  It does not appear to be a feature that is useful to me, but I would certainly like to see it in the future.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This is my first Super Tinker after using up 2 Tinkers and a couple of others. I'm a mechanic and general tinkerer and very hard on knives. The standard Tinker is nice and light and thin, but I found myself missing the scissors and went for this after finally destroying my last Tinker (abuse - my fault). The Super is not much larger than the Tinker, but I wouldn't keep either loose in my pocket for long. I find hanging them in my pocket from a key ring/belt clip saves my clothing and makes it harder to lose the knife.
  These knives are incredibly useful as a mini tool kit. I use the screwdrivers constantly, the awl makes a great drill, and the blades hold an edge pretty well. I often use the tweezers for removing splinters and deer ticks. It takes a substantial amount of force to break these knives (I figured out how much). So far I haven't used the scissors very often, but they are well made and work well.
  The toothpick is rather goofy, but I guess it's traditional to have one. The parcel hook has been useless so far, and I'd have preferred a file or something else. That said, I can't imagine not carrying a Swiss Army knife, and it's sad to have to leave it home sometimes because of increased security screening in some locations. Such is modern life."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I got the 3-pack and put one of them in an old torchiere floor lamp I had sitting around and the other two in my garage. The floor lamp had been pretty much useless because it was rated for a 60 watt bulb and I needed more illumination in my living room than that, I put in a couple of sets of halogen track lights years ago and I hadn't even bothered turning it on since. These actually only consume 11 watts, making it safe to use them in the lamp so now I get to use a 100 watt equivalent bulb.

But wait, there's more. I did a little informal comparison between this bulb and some other lights and I think that it's a little better than two 60 watt soft white bulbs when it comes to lighting up my room, and it's just as good as one of the halogen track light units. My family agrees with me on this; so, while it's hardly a scientific analysis, practically speaking, it'll do. (I think the main reason is that daylight spectrum reflects better off the white walls and ceiling than soft white.) It's also way cheaper to operate. I also prefer them in the garage to the soft white bulbs they replaced. They do cost a bit more up front than halogens, and quite a bit more than incandescents but with a much longer life and a small fraction of the cost to operate them I think they're an excellent purchase."

These were NOT waterproof. I tested them by filling the bath tub with 2-3 inches of water and standing in these boots - within 20-30 seconds both the boots let the water in. I am not sure if I got defective boots OR they are supposed to be only waterproof in light rain / light snow kind of situations.

The two-way mirror is a nice addition to my bike, especially if I can use the reflective lenses to reflect light into the sun. The lens is very thin and it is easy to hold with a pair of sunglasses. The glasses have a flexible outer shell that provides a good amount of light for cycling, which is nice for a beginner. I am happy with the quality of the product and would buy again.

The only downside I have is that I don't like the color of the lenses. I have had no problems with them being scratched, but I would have liked a better color.

But what we do have is a very well-written and engaging story about a young man's experiences as he becomes an intern at a large well-to-do church. In the hands of most writers I would have probably been bored to tears but Mr. Moody creates a fun and entertaining look into the quirks and idiosyncrasies of your standard Baptist style evangelical church. As one who has spent many years in ministry I can say he hit the nail on the head. No matter where you are or what you are doing people are a trip.

If you're the type that likes easy going stories with no stress or books that won't keep you up too late at night I suggest getting yourself a copy.

If you're concerned about the book being preachy because of the topic you have nothing to fear. There is very little Biblical reference at all. It's more about the people and the inner workings of ministry in general. You'll laugh and be entertained. Even non-believers will enjoy this book. It was a nice stressless experience for me and I enjoyed it much more then expected. It'll make a nice seashore read for a lazy vacation.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I bought these as a gift for my 20 year old son.  He is notoriously hard to buy shoes for.  Not only is he incredibly picky but he has wide feet and can not stand a tight fitting shoe  He would wear nothing but Sanuk's if he could but with snow on the ground, that is not very practical.

I purchased him both the Timberland Chestnut Ridge and these FRYE Dakota boots at the same time.  He tried both out around the house and decided to keep the FRYE.  The Timberlands were too narrow and the leather not nearly as supple as the FRYE, making the fit very uncomfortable.  He also thought the FRYE boot was just better looking overall.

After he wore the FRYE Dakota boot several times, he gave me the following feedback --

These are really great looking boots.  They offer excellent support/comfort around the ankles.  They are stiff but at the same time the leather is semi supple and giving, so walking in them feels great. I broke them in by strolling around NYC all day -- no blisters, chaffing or sore feet.  They have room in the toe box for my wide feet but not so much that they feel loose.  They sort of hug my foot but because the leather gives a bit, it's not an uncomfortable feeling at all.  Nice bonus -- they also add an inch or so to my height but hide it very well.

Thank goodness I finally found a boot he likes.  Hopefully FRYE lives up to its reputation for making long lasting boots!"

Recognising and understanding the differences between introversion and extroversion has particular application in our classrooms.

This book is sure to start lots of conversations in the staff room."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,They flicker and do not dim fully. These are cool white-nowhere near warm white. As expected the cool white stayed the same color when dimmed. The whole reason for dimmable lights is to create a more romantic atmosphere. Think candle light. The light must become redder than warm white. So we replaced the bulb with a tungsten bulb.
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,This clock is so cute and durable. I got it for my little girl so it would teach her responsibility in getting up on her own. I love the pink color and how it lights up pink. The covering is pink silicone. You set the time with the two buttons on top and it has the alarm set button on the left side use the hour and minutes buttons along with the alarm set button to set the alarm. You can use the button on the right side to cut the alarm off and on. It also has a snooze light button on top so you can see the time better in the dark. Push the button and the clock will illuminate for about 5 seconds so you can see the time. It runs on 3 AAA batteries (not included). Thank you for taking time to read my review :)

As other posters have indicated the materials are in the ""non-extreme but solid"" category, and are Jagwire branded though not in retail bubble packaging. Minimal packaging is fine by me.  You could pay a bit less, or you could pay a lot more, but a set of these on hand will get a bike out the door."

And even though there weren't as many sexual escapades in this story as in the others, it was nice to see Morgan connect with someone on a deeper level and figure out more about herself. And the little twist at the end with a villain from the series will definitely make things interesting for Morgan and her men! Can't wait for the next installment! Crossing my fingers that the next one is longer and we see more of Morgan's favorite men!!!!"

This is not about economics at all, more about sociology and how things that we believe are linked are not and how other occurrences do have connection.  Read the first chapter and see if you can put it down!  I recommend it highly because it challenges your thinking."

It's easy to find cheap sheets or good sheets, but getting to the perfect middle is difficult sometimes. I like the subtle design on the set, subdued but not invisible, and the feel of the cotton is very smooth, not scratchy or too tightly woven (it gets very hot here in the desert and high thread count sheets don't breathe as well as the lower count). It's still too hot to use the cover with a duvet, but it serves as a nice top sheet for now."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"I have pretty poor circulation in my fingers and toes and it's really difficult to find a pair of gloves that keep me warm. These almost do, and when the gloves and my hands are initially warm they work well. If the gloves are cold and my hands are cold (due to removing them outside for a reason) they do not work as well as I hoped. I bought them new but off Ebay for around $90 so I am keeping them. At that price they are a good deal. At over $150 I say look elsewhere. I know mitts have better heat ratings, so I might try those next, but I just like the feel of a glove when I ski."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,Way too small. I even bought a size up and they are still very tight. Almost less comfortable to cycle in these verses no padding (not saying much since there already is very little padding in these)

I also bought the TK-38 flashlight and it's a great little flashlight. I'm very pleased with it and will purchase more. I love it. Works great. I installed it in the kitchen and it works great. I also installed it in the bathroom with no problems. I'm very happy with it.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"An excellent shoe. I would strongly recommend getting a half size down. I wear a size 12 and purchased an 11.5. These fit perfectly. At first, they may seem stiff or even a little tight around the width of the toes, this does however subside after one or two wears. After mine broke in, they became one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I own. I can wear them all day while standing in the lab and I have very little discomfort. I definitely recommend buying a pair!"

I got the 12 month one when my daughter hit 17 lbs even though the 6 month size says it goes up to 18 lbs.  It is a little big but gives more room around the legs which she needs. She will be able to wear the 12 month size for awhile. I love how easily these diapers come on and off and they look so much cuter than the disposables.  They are waterproof, too!"

The primary reason I purchased it was to make sure I had a system that would trigger a failsafe in the event of signal loss (my cheapie radio would not). There are so many other great features to love about this radio. Smooth controls, plenty of programmable switches and because of it's popularity there are tons of youtube videos that demonstrate how to tweak it to your liking or even customize with voice commands and music. I have had it for a couple of months and am still geeking out on this thing. Maybe there is better out there, but I have no desire to look any further than this model."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I remember the 12 inch Indiana Jones doll back in 1981 that was out for about a week, it seemed anyway. It was imposable to find then and I have been waiting for it for years! (Because I wouldn't pay the ridiculous price for it as time went by).
Now with the new movie coming out, thank GOD, here come the Indy figures and dolls! (As nerdy as that sounds). I chose this one over the talking Indy simply because it looks more like Indiana than the other does. It isn't the old 81 doll I remember as a kid but it'll do, for now. The detail is nice as are the accessories. Unfortunately it has ""whip cracking action"" which means if you move a lever on his back his arm moves the whip up and down. Does anyone at Hasbro have the slightest clue how useless this feature is? It's a minor nuisance and overall it's worth owning though other companies are now making much better detailed versions of Indiana Jones in 12"" form."

It has a very nice feel to it and I like the fact that it is adjustable. I would recommend these to anyone. I love this tool, so much so that I bought one of them. I have a drill press, and a long tool that I use a lot. This tool is very handy for removing large pieces of wood and to do wood carving. It is very quiet. It is also very easy to set up and use. It is very useful for removing screws, bolts, etc. I would recommend this tool.

So we simply use the  mug with the lid off. We only had to show the grandkids how to lift the mug straight up rather than at an angle and that was that. Now our family room has no spilled drinks to clean up from floors, coffee tables, etc.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This lens is such a huge improvement over the standard kit lens. When I first acquired my Pentax Kr, I was very happy with the camera as I got back in to photography after being away for 15 years. The Kr is my first digital SLR and I felt that I could achieve great quality pictures without film with a reasonably priced kit. After 18 months, however, I was finding that there was still a quality to my images, particularly of people, that was lacking. At first, I thought it might be the camera. Then, on recommendations from other Pentax users, I decided to give this lens a try. Immediately, my images are sharper, and more colorful than with the standard kit lens. In addition, the larger aperture makes shooting in low light very easy and the bokeh is out of this world. I am very happy with this upgrade. I only wish that Pentax would have made the kit lens a bit better so it would be more useable."

I keep it stored in the refrigerator and so far we've used it to grate nuts and chocolate over ice cream as a topping, sprinkled over oatmeal, added to brownie batter before baking, and  it has even been used to grate pecans directly onto pancakes.

This mill comes with two different size blades. The smaller blade grates very small, the nuts come out looking like a nut meal. I prefer the larger size blade, nuts and chocolate come out with a nicer texture. The extra blade can be stored inside of the cap, which is a very nice feature.

I like the viewing windows on the side, you can see at a glance if you need to refill. I learned not  fill it too full, if filled too full screwing the cap back on can become a bit of a challenge. This mill seems to work better when it is lightly filled anyways, especially if you have a mix of different items inside so you can get a better mix when you turn the mill.

Just turn the mill like you would a pepper grinder and the grated nuts, cheese, or chocolate come out the bottom. There is a small cap that fits over the bottom that helps keep everything fresh and also helps keep any stray crumbs contained. This is very easy to use and helps make baked goods look a tiny bit fancier. This mill is a useful little kitchen gadget that I find myself using much more than I thought I would.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,"First thing I noticed is that the escutcheon *looks* nice with the nickel finish, but it is cheap plastic.  I have no doubt that after a few good cleanings, even the most modest of scrubbing pads would leave this looking awful.

Second thing is that it didn't even fit.  I'm replacing an original Moen trim kit.  My originial sits flush to the wall.  This one has about a 3.5"" ring that needs to be recessed into the wall by 1/4"" - not something easy to accomplish on an existing tile wall.  I have about a 2"" diameter hole where the valve comes out, but it's not big enough.  You can see what I'm talking about in the product picture - where the handle is attached, you can see that circle there and how it is recessed.

The one nice thing (not that it benefitted me at all) is that this kit tries to replace both old & new Moen configurations by providing several inserts to choose from.  This way you can match it to most Moens regardless of how your current one screws in to the valve.

I'm looking for a different kit that 1) sits flush and 2) might have a more durable faceplate."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"When I first started this book, it was just not engaging at all.  Something about the writing style and the very slow start really distracted me and kept me from being interested.  It definitely picked up somewhere in the middle and builds up from there finishing with a very satisfying ending.  Not that it matters all that much, but this book has one of the best endings I've read in a while.
Though the story is very slow at times and pretty repetitive at others, some of the concepts in it are really cool and unique (for me at least).  Things like time dilation, major cultural and societal changes to the human race over time, physics, and economics all play pretty large roles in the book.  These are very well explained and really engage the reader, causing one to think about them in a way not really presented in many sci fi books of the genre.  Another thing I enjoyed was the fact that this novel kind of envelopes two recurring themes that are popular in contemporary literature; space warfare\travel, and futuristic dystopian fantasy.  While you are shown intense, high speed warfare in distant galaxies, the earth and its people are undergoing some massive changes and not all for the better.  It is definitely kind of an interesting dichotomy that once again sets this book apart from many others for me.
Over all, the only detracting factor that I can find in The Forever War is its slow start.  The characters are strong, though not completely fleshed out, the setting(s) are really interesting and distinct and the actually story from start to finish is awesome.  It's a relatively short read too so definitely give it a chance and see it through to the end if you can. I doubt you'll regret it."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"These fit comfortably, no binding or anything anywhere, form fitting but not tight when sitting or bending.

The side pockets without buttons are handy, I like the slid in slot for a cell phone, but the rest of the pockets are mostly useless for me.  The front pockets are deeper than I'd prefer, and I've never been a fan of buttons on pockets.  The buttons on the back I just leave unbuttoned, since I only have a wallet I put back there, and the main pockets on the sides of the shorts I don't even use, just the smaller pockets for the cell phone.

The other downside is that the material is just a little too light for my taste.  I haven't had any issues with these, but I had a similar pair and last summer simply bumping against the rounded handle of my lawnmower's plastic push control was enough to split them in front of the pocket, not even in a seam, but in the middle of a panel.  These are a light, thin material like those were, so I'm going to be extra careful since I would prefer something a little more sturdy.

The color was rather darker than the picture showed as well - I like it, but if you're looking for something on the tanner side of the spectrum, these aren't the shorts you're looking for.

Belt is pretty much for display purposes only, I've never been a fan of this type of buckle.

The characters seem real, as their considerations and doings are quite slow and not jumping to conclusions although for once I wanted the story to be longer. You can't wait to see how his family develops and evolves, but most of all it's the language, the tone of the writing which makes it an easy and pleasant to read. Can't wait to read the next, but I hope Diesel is the one to go exploring, perhaps even secretly run away and get a cat girlfriend, as well as become more involved with solving the actual murder.

Estranged from each other and their father for many years, they are pleasantly surprised at the transformation of the Bed and Breakfast from ramshackle to opulent resort.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,CG,"First off, I'm a long-time fan of the wide-angle model.  This is the first one I've owned.  The front sight is very clear, and the rear sight is pretty straight.  I can see in the picture, that it's going to be a bit short for the long-sleeve version, but it will be pretty close.

I'll update this review if I find it helpful.

Update:  I've had this for about a month now.  It's bright and bright enough to see my neighbors.  I also don't have to worry about the metal going up.  It's just not on the low end of the range.  I've used this for about a month now and it's holding up great.

UPDATE 2/13/15:  I've tried it on a dirt bike and it's very bright, and I haven't had a problem with it.  It's not a deal breaker, but if you're running on dirt it's not a deal breaker either"

PROS:
- They are indeed light, and very sleek. Don't look bulky at all.
- They have great sound. They don't cancel noise very well, but I didn't want complete noise cancellation anyway (I think it's dangerous when you're walking on the street.)
- They are adjustable.
- They are comfortable.
- They come with a pouch, offering some protection.
- They come with a 1-year warranty by Amazon.

CONS:
- They aren't foldable. I wish they were more compact, the best I can do is rotate the swivel ear cups to a ""flat"" position.
- There aren't that many colors to choose from.
- They don't look or feel expensive. Granted these aren't expensive at all, but ""lightweight"" shouldn't mean cheap-feeling plastic.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Came in the mail really fast! 2 days time. Very good quality made ring. The brushed tungsten is darker than what the product photo shows, but still an attractive ring. My fiance' bought this as my wedding ring since we are on a budget, but again, it's very quality material & I'm very content with this purchase 

My ring finger was fitted as a 14 at some Jewelry Stores. I even had the chance to handle all the ring size rings myself to check it out, to find that perfect fit. 14 seemed to do the job. This ring does fit a tad bigger than what I was fitted for, so I would suggest you go down .5 of a size to ensure perfect fit. It's summer time here in Ohio & our fingers swell up in warmer weather, so the ring is secure enough not to fall off for now. But as soon as fall & winter arrive, I know I will have to purchase a 13.5 in a couple months so I can wear a ring in colder weather. But that's okay however, since the ring only cost the low price of $24, it won't even be an issue!

I hope my review helps someone in their decision making? There were other reviews specifically talking about the size offness, & with my confirmation, they were correct. Just buy one a half size smaller to match true fit!

God bless you all & may peace be upon you! I humbly ask for your prayers as I'm entering into Holy Matrimony here in 3 more days for a peaceful marriage, life longevity & happiness

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"I purchased 2 bras....this one and the Bali Women's Smooth U Front Close Bra.  I prefer T-back style bras because I absolutely hate when a bra strap falls down on your arms.  I am 135 pounds, 5'1"" and about a C cup.  I used the measurement advice found on the descriptions, and it showed me to be a 36C.  I am returning this bra for the following reasons:  1. The material is thin.  No padding, just a stretchy fabric.  I didn't realize this, so I guess I missed that in the description.  I might have kept it had it fit.  2. I had ""fall out"" all around the cup.  Not just a little, but a lot.  The straps were tight, and it goes up high on the collar bone, so there was literally breast poking out all the way up to the shoulders and collar bones area.  Have never had that experience before.  I loosened the straps to the lowest/longest position, and it only lightened the ""squish"" a little bit.  Still fall-out.  3. it was scratchy.  And to top it off, it was an expensive bra. THe other one I ordered (Bali) was only $16...and it fit like a dream.  Lots of support, comfortable, could sleep in it if i had to.  I know that Wacoal is a good bra maker, but I was looking for features that this particular bra did not deliver.

In trying out this cape coat, I can tell this coat is probably made based on Asian size, which means the size would be one to two sizes smaller than the US size. When I live in Taiwan, I usually wore small, and after I moved to the US, I wear x-small petite. So be aware of the size before you purchase this item. I will say go one size up if you follow the US size. For example. If you usually wear small in the US, you probably need to order a size Medium for this coat. I ordered an x-small. It fits, but the shoulder part might be a little bit tight. But I guess a small might be even better for me. The style of this cake coat is simple, cute, and elegant. It will go well with almost anything. It is light weight, and the texture is soft. It is sort of ""thin"" compared to a regular winter coat. It would be good for spring or fall l, but for winter, it will be too thin for me. The quality of the coat is ok. I won't say it is made from very good material. I can tell it might get wrinkled easily (for its thin material) if you do not fold it neatly. Overall, I like this coat. For its price, it is good enough."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"This is the first camera case I have ever bought so I don't have anything to compare it to.  As another reviewer mentioned, it is small inside unless you take out the divider. This case is meant for all S series cameras and I have an S700.  With the divider out there is plenty of room for the camera.

The top pocket inside the main case is mesh with a zipper closure, and the pocket on the front has room for two memory cards and an additional mesh pocket (no zipper, but the front pocket zips closed). The back of the case has a belt loop - though who could wear something this big on their hip?

I like that the case is not huge and bulky - fine for my needs, and it has a strong, detachable strap to carry over my shoulder.

Overall a good, well-made case that will last for a long time."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"After receiving Thank You for Your Service by David Finkel, I was curious about what it can deliver since its been ingrained in me toof coursebe thankful for the men and women who serve our country.  Instead, the sadness and depression, the mental toughness being questioned, and the realistic thoughts of suicide permeate many of the service men and woman who come home.  The author shares a completely different side of our troops.  Are we at home ready to not only thank them, but put them into a position to get on with their lives.  It may never be normal again, but they have lives to live and the supporting cast at home is just as impacted.  I took away a message that long-term and sustained help is required for many who need it badly.  I cant imagine what many of the soldiers saw and just knowing that they have to live with in their memories is upsetting.  The after-wars lingering effects can be haunting and I thank the author for bringing this to my attention.   Thomas B. Dowd III, author of The Transformation of a Doubting Thomas"

It can dim down significantly before I notice flicker (and it's not that bad even then and no worse than most any other bulb). I don't hear any high-pitched noise from it like I have with some light bulbs when dimmer (I haven't scrutinized it that closely I suppose, but some lights are so noisy when dimmed that it's hard to ignore).

It's got a pretty wide angle and is as good or better in that regard to the halogen it replaced. I have one of these in the ceiling of a room about 8'x8' (which is fairly small) and it is easily sufficient for the whole room."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I bought 1 of these to compare against other bulbs because it had decent reviews. This one was ok, but not as nice as the G7 Power G7GU10300WW for the same price. Please consider trying the G7 bulb and read my review of it.

UPDATE Dec-31-2013:

HitLights has sent me the updated bulb for 2014 to compare with the older bulb, and I'm pleased to say it is much improved from the old design. I'm also pleased they offered to send my a new bulb free of charge to try. Thats good customer service! First off the height of the bulb is now normal. It will not stick out of the fixture you place it in, like the old bulb did. The bulb looks exactly like what they have in the current pictures. I measured the new bulb as consuming 3.9 watts, which is more efficient than the old model (4.4 watts) and the same as my old favorite, the G7. The new bulb is a lot brighter too. I measured it at 5100 lux @ 1 foot away, compared to the old model @3860 lux. Its still not as bright as the old G7 at 7200 lux. But its acceptable. It comes on instantly and has a fairly linear dimming ability with a standard Lutron dimmer. It does have a little bit of yellow fringing at 1 foot away, but over several feet onto my dark brown granite countertop, it was mostly unnoticeable. Since the G7 is not available now, I would not hesitate to give this bulb a try. G7 however has redesigned their GU10 style bulb and it should be available soon. I always prefer products made in the USA, like the G7. I'm pretty sure this HitLights is still made in China."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"It has my seal of approval, and I fully recommend it.  I bought 2 of the Gizmode water alarm detectors, several sensor pad attachments, and 1 sump pump attachments.  Despite their very small sizes and nearly negligible mass, they all worked straight out of the box as I tested everything right away.  I found that the sensor pad attachments were as thin as advertised yet fully effective - they fit quite easily under our washing machine, and water heater.  Though the simplicity of the sump pump attachment surprised me, it was none-the-less very sturdy and worked well, so I placed it intentionally low in the sump so it would sound off just before the pump would activate - and it did.  The alarm was just loud enough to hear on the 2nd floor so my recommendation to Gizmode would be to make it even louder - but it still gets the job done.  It is now at the perfect ""peace of mind level"" where it is high enough in the sump that it won't sound off unless the sump pump fails to work."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"Functional, yes. Durable? We didn't get off to a great start together, this Pescadero 20 Carry-on and me.

I opened the package to find a loose zipper pull falling out at me and I couldve just ended my review there. Based on the other reviews, Im not the only person that received a flawed item out of the box. Id be wary of it and Id be wary that the other zipper pulls won't last. My internal zipper for the liner on the side of the handle also was missing a zipper pull altogether.

In terms of actually using the Pescadero to travel, it does reasonably well and holds itself up as a four-wheel spinner should, including its telescoping handle. I took it on a car trip, which is probably as much as I care to trust it. I like that its lighter than other 20-inchers Ive used before, although you can pay a premium for lighter weight specs if you choose elsewhere.

However, for flying, I don't like that it doesnt have any other exterior access compartment, nor does it have a TSA lock and no internal pockets. For a hard-shell exterior, its less rigid compared to my current hardshell. I can push the exterior in too easily with my hand alone. I cant put my trust in it and leave a proven, durable case behind when it will inevitably get checked and beaten on by baggage handling.

If I cant trust it, it doesnt fly with me. I expected better for the price."

When Ben is accepted at the police academy, James decides to take him on a 'ride along' to show him what the police world is really like.

It was easy to read and flowed easily. But, the subject matter was a little hard at times, and a little spicy too. I found myself wanting to yell at the hero  and heroine. I guess if you do that, then it's a very compelling book. I felt like I was there along side them every step of the way in their journey.  I went ahead and read the second book because this one left me hanging. I just had to see what happened next in Katie and Keith's lives.(because I feel like family now) I'm very glad I did because it made me appreciate what they went through and how redemption is such a gift of God.

And when she came home and found a naked man in her pool, she acted like she didn't even know who he was, and yet, he had been around for years while caring for her sick husband. I found that really, really odd. There was a lot of the inner thought process going on in both of their heads all through the book, and they weren't even complete thoughts, at that!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my brother and he loves it! He has really limited counter space, but needed a place for his K-cups so I looked into all of the different options. I debated getting him a freestanding holder that spins, but again, he has really limited counter space. Since he already has his Keurig on his counter, I figured I would get him something to go beneath it that wouldn't eat up any additional counter space. This was perfect and it's still going strong a year later."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"I bought two of these and they are the best. I will keep them for the next couple years. If I had to say, they are the best out there. They do not slip or slip. They are not stiff like a stock. They do not slide. They are not slippery. They do not break. I did not want to be able to walk out of my car without them. I had to take them out of the box and they all started to slide. I have used them for years and I have no complaints. I am very happy with them. I have a friend who has them and they work great"

I'm sure for a few extra dollars, they would have custom cut it for me, but for the price (Just over $100), it's an Awesome deal.

I even had extra room to include my MINI Drone and it's case.

Water Proof, Dust Proof, Lifetime No-Questions-Asked Warranty, Wheels, Pull Handle, 2 Carry Handles, etc...  Really, you cannot go wrong with this case, and the price is great!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this because my son was given a similar track system made by a competitor and loved it for the short time it functioned (hand-me-down gift).  However, all the vehicles were broken or lost besides the one I managed to rig up for a while.  I set out to find replacement cars and could not.  So buying this was the next best thing.

Let me tell you...my son absolutely loves this set.  In fact, he didn't stop playing with it for the entire first day he had it.  It seems well-made taking the price into account.  The track length is actually perfect considering I use the other one simultaneously. The cars have a lot of ""get up and go"", as well.

I am most impressed with the inclusion of extra parts.  I'd read reviews on Amazon before purchasing this set that complained about issues with the tire treads...When I opened the box, I found several replacement treads among other extras.  The track is easy for me to assemble and dis-assemble, but not for my two year old.

The set I received actually had a few additional parts to the track not shown in the picture, which adds to the fun!

I'm worried about the cars being damaged because my son is a bit rough with them and there seems to be no way to replace just the vehicles if this does happen. So that annoys me, but overall I'm very pleased with this purchase and my son didn't stop smiling...My 9-year-old god son likes it, as well!!"
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"This movie is an outstanding example of what digital technology can achieve visually. For this, it deserves 2 stars.
What a pity, however, that so much tecnical effort distracted the makers and made them forget the importance of a good plot.
This is truly a lost opportunity, an anti-statement in sci-fi.
Maybe next time the combination of this tecnicians with the ideas provided in the stories of people like Bradbury, Henlein, Asimov, will achieve the final fantasy: a digital masterpiece that will score as Blade Runner did in its time........"

The light dimmed a bit and then the light returned to a dull white light.  I still liked the light, but it had some light leakage to it.  The sunshade is actually a bit brighter than the original one.  If you have a light source that is just a cheap LED, you can't beat the price.  It's very bright.  I have yet to find a light source that will last long enough for me to put it up on my vehicle.  It's definitely worth the money.

I bought a couple of these swim diapers for my daughter to use in swim class, and they have been working wonderfully but have never been ""put to the test"".  Well today that all changed, and my daughter had a massive blow out at her swim class.  Not the easy to clean type of blow out either, liquidy, messy and disgusting (and utterly mortifying).  That being said, this diaper contained it.  I don't even know HOW it contained it.  My daughter's teacher literally lifted her out of the pool to give her to me to decontaminate her and she said, ""wow - this is a good swim diaper""."

The only downside is that it's very hard to mount.  The ring itself is a bit loose and that means it won't fit in the rail.  Otherwise it is very secure.  The only downside is that it's a bit loose and will cause the rail to slide around a bit if you use it on a bipod.

I'm considering purchasing another one of these for my AR-15.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"This is an intriguing documentary. It doesn't defend the practice of bestiality, but instead makes viewers acknowledge that zoophiles are utterly human, not evil or sinister. This is a story about a group of friends with a disturbing fetish (perhaps even a distinct sexuality, since they don't seem very interested in other humans). When an accident happens and things go too far, their community unravels and people are exploited by the media and shamed by the public. It's a very sad story, but one worth watching. I feel particularly badly for the animal companions who were confiscated or sold away in the aftermath of this event.

There are confusing elements to this documentary, particularly in regards to which interviewee is narrating--I recommend watching it with the subtitles running. It lost me at points. There are definite flaws in the storytelling, but it's still so compelling that I put up with those flaws.

I recommend this film to anyone who is fascinated by sexuality or who seeks to understand outsiders."

I really didn't expect this book to be as good as it was, but I was pretty disappointed.  The story is very boring.  The characters are not interesting.  There is nothing to interest me.

-Easy to use
-Cons:
-Not as heavy as I had hoped for
-Very poor quality materials
-Very thin plastic

-Sturdy and sturdy, but my cats would not touch it

-The clasp is a little too small
-My cat is a big chewer and I thought this was a cute toy to hold in her mouth. She just pulls it out of her mouth and then shakes it around so the clasp slides down into her mouth. I feel like the clasp is too tight because she is very far away from it. I wish they had made this one a little bigger. I would have given it a 5. The clasp is very sturdy. The clasp is very comfortable. The clasp does not slip out of the clasp, so it is secure and secure. The clasp is very easy to put on and remove.

I had seen the movie version several times and in my opinion I really enjoyed the book so much more (Although the movie earns it's own merit's). It left me speechless and it really made me think about what Scarlett O'Hara had been through and it really made me for feel her and the other characters in the story. I was really impressed with the story Margaret Mitchell created. I can see why this got the Pulitzer Prize in 1937.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"The author may have gotten some tips from those classic MasterCard commercials which illustrate that money can buy some things, but certain moments and life experiences are ""priceless.""

Through the beautifully and simply illustrated tale of friendship between a cat and a dog (the interspecies metaphor alludes to openness and acceptance of differing points of view and experiences), we learn that material possessions and tangible items are sometimes not as meaningful as the space between two individuals, people, living beings, etc.  It is the unspoken, uncategorizable, sublime moments of life that are most fulfilling and rewarding, and the hardest to capture or describe.  Therefore, when trying to convey the depth of meaning of these moments, we cannot, and therefore, should not even bother trying (to encapsulate them, try as we may through photographs, video, blogging, etc.).  The best gift is one that one already has the power to give oneself--the gift of friendship, self-awareness/mindfulness and the ability to honor and nurture the two."

Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"Another brain-damaged design by Sony - a well-built, almost completely perfect device crippled to the point of being worthless by a small oversight.

This device starts tracks at the beginning after it powers off and you turn it back on.  This makes it a definite no-go for most people as it can't be used for long files such as audio books.

I contacted SonyStyle support before buying because the specs didn't indicate that it would resume tracks at the current point, and I wanted to know for sure before I bought it.  I have had a history of items from Sony that are like that - designed and tested by engineers, but completely untouched by non-techie consumers.  SonyStyle support assured me that it would resume tracks at the current point when powered off.  After buying and receiving the item, I couldn't find anything in the instructions about how to resume at current point, so I called SonyStyle again.  After 45 minutes of insisting that it would do it and attempting to do it on his, the tech finally admitted that it wouldn't.  It would only restart the current track.  He also couldn't give an ETA on a firmware update that would allow this.  So, (thanks Amazon), I sent it back. No more Sony for me.

It may be fixed at some point in the future by a firmware update, but caveat emptor.

For those that care, the players I found that do allow resume AND have PlaysForSure (no iPods here):

Creative Zen Stone (PERFECT device, awesome in every aspect)
Sandisk Sansa (AAA battery; when it dies you lose your place)
Samsung YPZ5 (cool but clunky, kind of expensive)

No PlaysForSure:

Sean Whitcomb is up for a promotion at his law firm, the test is a dinner for the bosses with his partner to prove his family values. Sean could burn water, but his ex lover Isaiah is a world class chef, so he calls in a favor. Isaiah Waterston has never gotten over the betrayal he felt when Sean left him to pursue his career ten years ago. So when Sean asks him to pretend to be his lover for the weekend and cook a meal for the bosses, Isaiah is hesitant. He makes an assanine comment about topping Sean in exchange for his help, and immediately regrets it when Sean agrees.

Dinner is a huge success as is dessert which consist of Sean laid out naked on the dining room table for Isaiah&iexcl;s tasty treat. The two spend a whirlwind, sex filled weekend together and Sean is more than eager to make his pasts mistakes right. But Isaiah is not buying it and leaves while Sean sleeps and to add salt to the wound, he doesn&iexcl;t return his texts or calls. Can Sean convince Isaiah that he still loves him, he&iexcl;s changed and he&iexcl;d give up everything he&iexcl;s worked ten years to build for another chance with him? Or was one last hoorah all Isaiah was in this for?

I have a new found fascination with interracial M/M novels and novellas, and Dessert did not disappoint! A fast, fun read with some jaw dropping sticky sex on the table that involves bananas and ice cream. The story centers around the present situation with Sean trying to get his lover back, attempting to make up for past mistakes. But there&iexcl;s enough of the past and their individual current lives sprinkled in to add a little depth to the story. If you&iexcl;re looking for a quick read that ends with a cold shower, this is the book for you!

Books_5,3.0,OR,"I'd give it 3 and a half stars, if half a star was possible.  Derleth's take on Lovecraft follows a certain theme that doesn't change all that much from story to story:  thin, white, bookish, guy inherits spooky old house by some half-forgotten relative/friend; weird stuff happens that he can't explain; bookish guy inevitably does research in old tomes at Arkham; and the story ends in a paragraph of italics that's supposed to fill you with a sense of horror.  The sense of spookiness that permeated throughout Lovecraft's stories is absent, replaced by an extremely predictable italicized ending.  I have to agree with the reader from San Francisco, the Good gods versus the Bad gods was not a great idea.  Of course it doesn't really matter, since a few gods are merely mentioned in passing when the bookish guy does research at Miskatonic.  Derleth seems to prefer Lovecraft's theme of evil rednecks in the backwoods of Massachusetts rather than promoting anything in the Cthulu mythos.  All in all, stay far far away from this book if you've never read Lovecraft, and if you have read him than you don't really need to be in a hurry to pick this one up."

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I pitched this fun device as a drone to my son, who thought it was the best thing in the world.  We took it to the local soccer field and we were off! Or rather, we were off to a wobbly start.

The Jump Jet is technically a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicle, capable of rising and descending like a helicopter and buzzing around in the air like a plane.  We liken it to Windblade, the Autobot who transforms into a VTOL jet.

The Jump Jet looks like a jet but it takes off like a helicopter, which means it ascends by drifting backward and then launching upward.  It takes some maneuvering to get this right, as it's not one helicopter blade over the center but two blades, which causes the drift.  There's even a control to adjust for this drift, but good luck using those while you're trying to get the Jump Jet to take off.

Once it takes off, there's another button to transform it (see?) into jet mode.  I was torn between shouting ""Form of...a JET!"" and making that sound Transformers make when they do it, but my kids were already nervous about flying this thing in public so I decided to keep their embarrassment to a minimum.

The transformation to jet comes suddenly, which requires a completely different set of flying skills.  Where before I was simply trying to keep the thing from crashing into the ground or to a child, now it's a matter of keeping it aloft and moving forward.

I took me several tries to get the Jump Jet to take off, transform into jet mode, fly around, and then transform back into helicopter mode to land.  By the time I finally managed it, it was out of power.

My eight-year-old tried this several times and was never able to get it, but he was very helpful in running all over creation to bring it back from the latest crash landing."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I have narrow feet and a high arch, so need a shoe that has good arch support, good cushioning and low volume but still roomy toe box that is not too stiff.  I've been a Salomon fan and own several older model XA Comps/XA Comps GTX and took that on many trips (from hiking in the desert to trails in Hawaii).  I now need replacement shoes since I've killed the old ones.  For athletic shoes, I'm usually a 9.  For all Salomon, I wear a 9, same for these (I also wear 9 in ASICS, but 9.5 in Nike, Brooks and Puma).

I tried on just about every major brand to look for some trail hikers/trail runners and they all fit too wide.  I also tried the Salomon XA Mission, which got rave reviews, but the toebox fits extra wide.  I also tried the Salomon Crossmax, which had a great arch but fit like a motion control shoe, so my gait felt very stiff and unnatural.

The Speedcross 3 purple looks great and the fit is perfect:  strong arch support, well cushioned, hugs my narrow feet very well, low volume toebox but still plenty of room to wiggle toes. I also love the speedlaces, easy to use and works great.

The tread is very aggressive, which is great for mud and trail.  But I will warn that walking on hard surface felt a little weird as I can feel the treads ""wiggle"" (compress, tweak side-to-side and rebound), it's a low ""wiggle"" so I don't feel unstable in any way. Not sure how the treads will wear on hard surface over time.

The shoe also feels very light for a water resistant shoe, it's not Gortex but Climashield.  It's supposed to be breathable but I haven't tested the waterproofness yet, but will testing them soon on the trail.  Highly recommend for grass, dirt, any soft surface, trail or muddy/wet conditions."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I was puzzled to see why this only has four stars, since mine is beautiful and works great. I did have to unscrew it when I first got it because the battery had come loose and was rolling around in the lamp, but I simply stuck it back into place and the lamp works fine. The colors are vibrant and really pop both during the day and when it's lit up at night. And the light is actually a rather bright white, which is emitted from a small stalk of three tiny LED lights gathered into a bunch at the bottom, like grapes. The stake leaves a little something to be desired, though, since it was a little difficult to put together (I had to take the screw out of the pole and then re-insert it, since it was in crooked) and it's not the sturdiest while in the ground. The stake itself is fine enough, but the pole is so narrow that it can't really support the weight of the lantern, which causes the lamp to easily swivel around. But once it's in place, it's fine. I have it next to my walkway to add curb appeal to the front yard, and it looks really pretty both during the day and at night.

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"This is very light for a Feld game.  I've played other light Feld games such as Builder's Duel and The Speicherstadt but for the most part his games tend to be meatier/deeper experiences.

In this game players draw 3 cards each turn.  Each card has 3 possible uses and players determine which card is going to be used for each of the three functions that turn.  One will be used to give the player a special ability, the other to get a resource, and the last to move an animal track marker up.  In between the second and last action players also put an explorer on a board in order to surround and collect animal tiles.  These tiles are the main source of points in the game.  The game lasts until the animal track markers are at a certain level and the player with the most points wins.

I typically really like the mechanic of cards being used for multiple different purposes and having to choose which role to fit each of your 3 cards in each turn presents a lot of opportunity cost decisions that make this game, despite being reasonably light, also reasonably deep and engaging.  There's a little bit of competition and reading your opponents as everyone is playing in the same space and especially with more players there can be competition for certain aspects of the game.  That said, the game is a lot more interesting with more players.  It is fine with 2, but each player can tend to focus on their own thing and there is less interaction.

The accessibility is a great boon for this game, this is a game that is quick to get up and running with almost anybody and because it is still reasonably engaging and deep you don't sacrifice that in making a lighter game."

I did not want to write my review too early until after I had used this pan on a regular basis.  I did stick a post-it note on my range for the family to take note to never put this pan in the dishwasher and to only use PLAIN WATER and a scrubby sponge or paper towel to wash this pan.  The instructions say to not use lemon-based dishwasher detergent to clean it.  I guess I have taken that a step further with only using water to clean it.  Sometimes I have just heated up a little water and then turn the heat off and let it sit.  This has been working and the non-stick surface is still very much intact.  So far, by doing this, it has performed better than any other non-stick pan I have ever owned.  I have not treated my past non-stick pans this way and they have ended up being recycled.  Tonight I cooked chicken breast tenders with MCT oil and garlic and rosemary and they turned out very tasty but f I usually only cook eggs in it.  I am babying this pan and I love it and it is still beautiful!  Never use non-stick spray in a pan like this and the instructions for this warn against using olive oil which I am taking to heart.  Real butter is okay and a little goes a long way!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I have friends who are SCCA corner workers and others who are EMTs and Firefighters. Both are jobs that can involve cutting, prying open, grabbing hot or sharp things, etc.  I saw this as a good tool to keep in my car to use ""just in case"" I had a chance to be a hero, like my friends. But first, I brought it to church to show my firefighter friend and get his thoughts. Here's what he said:

He thought it was a little heavy to carry but he thought he would be able to substitute it for a couple of other tools he carries. He liked the combo pliers/wire cutters and saw how they could be used to turn, bend or cut through wires or grills. He immediately recognized the key slot that could close gas valves. The pry bar end too could be useful to open stuck doors or smash windows. Finally, and the reason for only 4 stars, the fire hose tightened isn't very useful since he say that you really need two to snug up the joint.

Quality build, several useful tools, a little heavy, worth a try for the heros in your life!"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I practice and teach olympic lifting, and I put these through the paces yesterday doing snatches and handstands - two movements where my wrists feel weakest. Out of the package, these felt really high quality, and they didn't disappoint during the actual use either. They provide a good amount of support without limiting natural movement. The construction is excellent and the material feels sturdy and exactly what I expect from good wraps. The seams are well done, the velcro is strong, both wrist wraps are the same length and everything is even and exact. The elasticity is good - just enough give to be able to tighten well, but not cut off circulation. I have small wrists, and the 12"" fit me. Like most wrist wraps that I've used, these are made to wrap twice around the wrists. This was plenty of support for me on handstands and snatches both, and the wraps didn't feel bulky or limiting. For my smaller hands, the thumb loop is the exact right length to guide the placement of the wraps.

Overall, very happy with these and will be using them almost every day. For anyone new to using wraps, prepare to love having pain-free wrists. I recommend airing all workout accessories after every use, and washing often, to ensure everything stays clean and smelling nice.

I received these wraps at a discount to test and provide an honest review. I wouldn't want anyone to buy a bad product, so I test with a critical eye and write my honest and unbiased thoughts so others can make informed product decisions."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"My initial review of this was very positive. We like these very much. But my daughter started developing a rash above her lip where the bottle was touching. She has done this with other metal bottles without issue, even with her metal sensitivity. But these bottles must have a high nickel content or something because she is very clearly reacting to them. Now I have to send her to school with this bottle AND a stainless steel straw so she can drink from them. Ugh. I wish we had figured it out sooner. We would have returned them.  My original review is below in case you don't have a metal issue and want to know more about the product:

Easy to clean, easy to open. They have a smaller opening than many of our bottles which is nice, too. No problem with the tops in the dishwasher either (most of our other bottle tops have to be hand washed). So we are very pleased with these and bought several more after trying them out."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is the most psychotic book ever written! The faint-hearted and easily sickened need not read this 'cause it'll do it for ya! Ok, so the beginning's a little slow--so what? This book rules!  The only bad thing about is the HUGE description of how Chyna's chained to the chair.  Vess is  definitely a very interesting character (if not completely terrifying) and  his job just makes everything even better!  Chyna's sort of stupid for  following him but that took serious guts and hey--it was a lot more  interesting than just calling the police and cowering in the corner til  they got there.  This book makes most other horror/suspense thrillers look  like nice, safe little fairy tales!  For the millionth time and as so many  others have said before me: Dean Koontz is da man!  Yeah, baby!"

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

I admit, that I was a little confused at first. The person who wrote the ""Single Guy"" column, was he Matthew Rhodes, or Ryan, or were they the same guy?  After I figured that out, it was pretty smooth sailing.

Ryan's column was a somewhat cynical view of Love, and the column Mia wrote, ""Lonely Girl"", was more about single women navigating the dating scene. When Ryan and Mia first met, they each had no idea they were with the person behind the column. Their focus was on the 'reality' of Love as they saw it.

They had great chemistry going until Mia figured out that Ryan was Lonely Guy and bolted. They both end up on a Bachelor type dating show as contestants. They each have their own agenda for appearing, and it is not to fall in love. Both Ryan and Mia were shocked to find out they were both going to be on the show.  I did love their back and forth teasing and wittiness in their conversations.

One not believing in love. The other feeling unlovable. There was blackmail, corruption, deceit, manipulation, love, loyalty, and family throught this book. Let's not forget a few steamy sex scenes. There is a HEA, no worries there.

This was a fun, romance read. My only regret was there was no detail on Mia's boss ever getting what was coming to her. I also wasn't 100% sure if Ryan got to write the article that he really wanted to and use some of the information against Mia's boss. I was left wanting more.

Maybe that's a good thing...."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I used one of these on a build I did for a friend and was very impressed with the quality. It was matched with a Vortex Strike Eagle 1-8. A quality mount is important as the best optic is useless if you match it to junk rings. That said I didn't want to spend as much on the mount as I did on the mount and had read good things about this mount. The rings are uniquely hinged. The mount itself is well machined and very light weight. Aero has gather a good reputation for itself by making good quality items at fair prices and this mount is exactly that.

There are a few things to be aware of. Because of the way the rings are made the scope has a tendency to turn in the rings when they are tightened. You can try to compensate for that. Or you can apply a light coat of oil to the ring/scope allowing them to move. The second is that because the mount is aluminum and the screws are steel you need to be very careful with your torque. The mount comes with a allen wrench and instructions which I recommend you follow carefully and you will have no issues. Do no over tighten as it is easy to strip the aluminum threads. All in all this is a fantastic mount for a very good price and a great optic for an ultra light build."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"The short stories of ""The Academy"" & ""Third Watch"" are best read before any of the Tracy Crosswhite novels. Both are short introductions to the character and explain why she decided to give up her profession to be a cop. Both are only 45-47 pages, yet both have a good deal packed into a short space. Each short stands alone as Mr. Dugoni carries a separate plot in each. Together, they make for a novel and complete introduction to the main and supporting characters. ""Academy"" should be read first, then ""Third Watch."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I have read several of the stories in this series and this one is probably the most hilarious. In this series men can get pregnant. It's actually the way they know that the other man is their true mate. And all have to get over some obstacles to reach their HEA.

Bobby decides that he has to get away from his family. After having seen his brother be awfully abused by their own father and knowing that his fate would be similar when his true nature was revealed, he knows he must seek out. Stupidly enough he starts his get away journey on a very cold night. Poorly dressed he is fortunate to meet Nick and his two friends who are driving aimlessly around. They deliver him at the ranch where his brother Isaac is living with his mate.
Bobby meets his own mate there, but he does not want to give in, not to begin with anyway. It takes some effort from Shott and help from among others Shott's grandfather before the stubborn Bobby realizes where his future lies.

There are some quite distinct hints as to who Nick actually is and some magic wielded to underline that. There is a mentioning of a crossroad demon. And the solution as to who had sent the killer after Bobby is not easy to accept.

I have the feeling this might be last book of this series, but there is always Mason who still is without a mate."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I enjoyed Dead Running very much. It had a great combination of action, romance, and witty dialogue.  There definitely were some obvious plot twists and turns but that just added to the book's charm- it was a fluffier suspense book with plenty of fun occurrences and tame romance to really engage the reader. I liked all the characters too which was a plus.

A couple of things for me that kept it from being a five star:  the ending did not have full closure, so I am assuming that there will have to be a follow-up book(s), otherwise everything is left to the imagination. That was a bummer. Second while the book was fun and I liked all the characters, Cassie was sometimes very immature. Her actions made me cring a few times.  It also annoyed me that for a person with a degree in the fitness and health industry, she did not really know her craft. Kind of made me feel like she was a bit of a dough-head and I did not want to feel that way about her.

Overall a great read if you are in the mood for something not so serious- a fun romantic suspense."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Fright fans, rejoice: thrills have been found again.

""Tales of the Dead: Grim Stories of Curses, Horror and Gore"" is an exploration of suspense. Divided into four vignettes, the film offers a variety of Halloween pleasures--each certain to impress those craving more than the standard cinema fare.

In this meet of multiple genres (each story chronicles a different element of horror, from the paranormal to the all too real) viewers will be offered a relentless pace and satisfying conclusions. The film does not falter as it changes tones and characters. It instead generates intrigue. This marks it unique among the typical plots. There are no tedious interludes or wasted moments. There is instead simply tension. It allows each individual to remain captivated; and this is a rarity.

What is not so rare, however, is the one flaw ""Tales of the Dead"" bears: its special effects. Like so many of its kind the film is limited by a too tiny budget. This forces occasionally laughable results and poorly constructed attempts at terror.

Those attempts are not enough to ruin the experience, however. While they may cause the viewer a momentary regret, they will still be countered by efficient storytelling and convincing acting--which offers far more than mere effects."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"The essence of a good novel is its ability to whisk you away to a place where you would not normally go. Linda Collison does such a thing wonderfully in her debut novel, Star-Crossed. Patricia Kelley sets out in 1760 from her paupered but privileged place in English society to claim her dead father's only estate asset, a sugar plantation in Barbados. Stowing away on a boat, she is first moonstruck by a bosun's mate, Brian Dalton, but then faces the dilemma of choosing Dalton's love or marriage's security with a more sensible choice to marry the ship's doctor, MacPherson. The entire story swings many times like a pendulum between this two contrary choices.

Along the cruise, readers are exposed to life on several English navy ships are Patricia travels with Dalton and/or MacPherson to various Caribbean locales in changing circumstances. As she literally rides the staterooms by day and the yardarms by night, her life takes equally polar changes that can be sensually experienced by those wishing to join her on the page. Her final destination satisfies both her heart and her head.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I found The Business of Being Born to be very informative and definitely worth watching, I highly recommend it. I have only a couple complaints:

1. A bit of nudity towards the end, my husband and I would've appreciated more modesty. I've had one hospital birth, two home-births, with a third at the end of this year. I can therefore say with some measure of authority that it's not necessary to walk around topless or nude. Yes, birth is perfectly natural. So is sex, urination, and defecation. I'm not going to do any of those on screen.

2. I like home-birth because it feels so right, I have no other way to explain it. I'm a major advocate for home-birth, but what I can't stand is the ""movement"" associated with it. I do the home-birth because it's better for the child being born, the rest of the family, as well as myself (barring an emergency comes up, obviously). It's about mommy and baby, not ""empowerment"" and ""I am woman, hear me roar"". It's irritating and, in my opinion, it degrades women who choose to home-birth."

I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a soft mattress.  I have two of them in my bathroom and one in a closet.  I was able to find one of them on Amazon for $15 more.  I would definitely recommend this mattress to anyone looking for a soft mattress.Very nice looking.  I have not used it yet but I will update when I do.I have always wanted to own these so I could take pictures of them on my computer.  They are very easy to set up and I can use them on my computer to take pictures of everything.  I also like the way they are colored and the fact that they are on the bottom of the picture so you can see the whole thing.  I will probably buy more and buy more.  The quality is good too.  I would definitely buy them again"

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I am extremely large-busted and was in search of a ""miracle"" bra to solve several problems I have with most bras.

1) My everyday bras with underwire were always poking, chafing and causing a rash.
2) Exercise was difficult since no bra supported me well enough to prevent bounce.
3) I needed a bra to sleep in for extra support but didn't want to buy a ton of bras just for that purpose.

The Fiona bra has come closer than any other I've tried at meeting my needs.  The material is soft and absorbent with no underwire, and yet I feel better supported (for everyday wear) than I did in a Bali underwire bra.  It moves with my body, absorbs sweat, and doesn't chafe or poke me anywhere, so it's very comfortable to sleep in.  It's also supportive enough for low-impact exercise; however, it is NOT supportive enough to prevent bounce while jogging or during other high-impact exercise.  Maybe that's just not a possibility for me and someone a little smaller would have better luck.  I should mention that I'm wearing this bra in size 44DD and that it's actually a little small in the cup area.  Fortunately, it launders well.  I haven't found any change in the bra's size or shape from putting it through my washer and dryer.

One other negative is that the bra looks like a sports bra with wide straps and seams running along the sides.  This is fine except for the fact that it makes it a little difficult to wear the bra under all tops as an everyday bra.  Depending on the cut of the top and the material, either the straps or the seams or both will sometimes show through.  This is annoying but not enough of an issue to make me stop using this bra for daily wear.

Overall, I find the bra to be excellent for my full figure.  Although it's not quite my ""miracle"" bra, I still plan to buy more of these."

I like that the very first time I used it I felt it was going to break, but I'm not sure how long it would hold up.  I am still using it, but it's kind of stiff and takes up space, so I'm not sure how long it would hold up.  I'm a bit concerned it will break in the future, but the only thing I don't like about it is that it's not really a very well made product.  I will probably get a second one for the bedroom as a gift.I love this crockpot!

Books_5,4.0,CG,"True to Kay Arthur's study of the relationship between the two characters. There is a strong connection to the two characters that is often missed by many readers, and the author is very clear that it is a relationship between Kay and Stephanie, both of whom have come to terms with their feelings for one another. Kay is determined to get Stephanie out of the relationship with Kay, and Stephanie is determined to get Kay out of it. Kay is determined to get Stephanie out of the relationship with Kay, and Stephanie is determined to get Kay out of the relationship with Kay, and Kay is determined to get Kay out of it. The story is not only about Kay, but about Stephanie, and the book is full of both of them. There is a lot of action, and a lot of twists and turns, but it is not the most compelling story. My only criticism of the book is that the ending was a bit abrupt. There was a lot of tension in the book, and the ending was not unexpected. However, the plot of this book was well paced, and I was very excited to read the next book in the series. I have never read a book that was so abrupt that I felt like I was in a story."

There were a few major twists I didn't see coming and it was a fairly quick and engaging read but nothing particularly upsetting."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This is a great coloring case.  It has a crayon set, a colored pencil set, and two sets of markers - pip squeak sized small markers and regular size.  As other reviews have noted, it costs about the same as it would to buy all the included crayons, pencils, and markers separately at full price.  The separates will go on sale, and so will this case.

Crayola is good quality.  The products are not light fast, so over time, pics left in windows or bright light will fade.  Colors are bright and markers last longer than dollar store products.  Crayons are the best, since many other brands are waxy and weak.  This set has washable markers, but not the washable crayons or pencils.  So, needs supervision for small children who might write on the wall.  Crayons are made in the US; pencils made in Brazil; case and markers made in Vietnam.

The carrying case has plastic shells glued to the inside that hold the crayons, pencils, and markers.  It looks all neat and tidy, and the latches hold it closed fine for carrying around.  I have not yet lost markers, but since I got this to share with a two year old, some marker tips have been damaged.  Sets drive me nuts when I start missing pieces, but that's the nature of sets.  The plastic shell on this one won't come out, which is good for a full set, because I much sturdier, but means I can't gut it easily later.  The carrying case has a minion with teddy bear on one side and a minion playing a guitar on the other.

My particular set came with two of the same color crayon:  banana bonanza.  I know this means that I'm missing a color in my set, but I'm not OCD enough to go through and look at every crayon to find out which color got left out to allow room for that double."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure the 16 movie version is not legit.  The DVD menus are just a still image.  There is absolutely no copy write information on anything or any warnings...  Each dvd just has a still image with the list of movies at the bottom to select.  I noticed the audio cutting in and out and switching from 5.1 or stereo while watching it, this only happened a few times.  The quality seems to be normal for dvd's.  Keep in mind that everything will look fuzzy on a large HD tv, but that is normal.

That said, I got this for like 30 bucks, and that is an amazing deal considering that these movies are sooo ridiculously overpriced individually.  The Blu Ray version of these movies go for 30-40+ dollars a piece, which is total BS in my opinion.  I definitely recommend this, but don't spend 1 or 200 bucks on this like some people are saying, there are plenty of 30ish dollar copies out there if you look.  There are several listings for this on amazon, do a more general search if you can't find them."

Books_5,2.0,OR,"Hello Darkness has a convoluted story line that's forgettable about five minutes after you've finished reading it.  The story's main character, Paris, is the host of a late night radio show.  Besides playing music, she also gives her callers advice.  When a caller asks advice about her love life, Paris tells her to drop her loser boyfriend, who also happens to be one of Paris's normal callers.  This turns out to be bad advice, as the dumped boyfriend decides to abduct her.  This is the start of an incoherent story involving an old flame of Paris, whose son is involved with a sex club website that the abducted girl's father runs.  Yes, it's about as silly as I described.  The book is not well written, not remotely memorable.  I would recommend passing on this novel.

It is a fun read and I recommend it for anyone who wants to learn about the war in the 70's.I found this book to be very interesting.  I found myself thinking about my own experiences with war, and the devastation of war in the south.  The descriptions of the war and the hardships that it caused were well written.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Psychologist Daniel Hughes has done it again with his newest book, Attachment-Focused Parenting. In his highly-skilled and talented manner, Hughes has managed to take the complex terms and concepts of attachment theory and make it accessible for the reader. Hughes helps us to better appreciate that the parent-child relationship is a two-way interaction, with each being greatly influenced and affected by the other. Of equal importance, he helps the reader to see that parenting goes way beyond guidance and discipline; rather, both parent and child require a context for understanding what happens between them, and each is influenced by their own history.

Hughes relies extensively upon examples and real-life scenarios as he makes his points. In doing so, he appeals to a wide spectrum of parents. That is, he cites the example of a four-year-old who screams with frustration, while later addressing the parent-child struggles of a 16-year-old. Independent of age, however, the concepts Hughes lays out are universal for all children, regardless of age.

Get ready, though, as Hughes reminds us that the parent's own attachment history greatly affects the parent-child relationship. This certainly isn't new, as how often have we caught ourselves saying, ""I never thought I would say/do what my father/mother did..."" Without writing a self-help book for parents, Hughes proposes some questions and concepts parents should ask themselves about their own history, given the part it plays in raising their kids.

As a child psychologist who primarily works with foster and adopted children and their families, I continually deal with kids who have their own attachment issues to work through. While a professional can assist a child in this regard, much of the work to be done centers on the child's relationship with her parent, be it foster, adoptive, or birth. Because of this, Hughes' book will be at the top of my reference list for the parents I work with, but also for other professionals."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I've had this shape wear for nearly one year.  It probably does run a tad small but it also needs to be snug to do its job.  I am short- 5'2""- and (was) 40ish lbs overweight so I ordered the L.  It fit very well with no riding up or sliding down at all.  There are no lines visible on your clothes to even hint that you're wearing something like this.  I ended up ordering another in the 2nd color & wear one or the other most days. It hasn't seemed to wear out in any way with numerous washings over the year.  In fact, drying them helps them regain snugness.  After a decent weight loss, it obviously doesn't work quite as well but I like the product enough to order both colors in a smaller size, perhaps even a couple of each.  They are comfortable and just help me feel sleeker, whether it's under a business suit, dress, or jeans!  Honestly, I feel wrong going without them now.  Compared to most effective shape wear, you simply cannot beat the price.  At my height, it does pull up to my bra line, which seems appropriate to me.

I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to smooth out their shape & just feel slimmer!"

Books_5,4.0,OR,"First, the outstanding quality of Joanne Harris' writing is her use of mouth-watering culinary descriptions.
Her plot here is much more involved than in Blackberry Wine, and much darker.  I happen to like the darker in terms of reading (my favorite is C.J. Cherryh's Cyteen; check THAT out), but I do have to say the narrator was hard to sit next to for the length of the book.  Witty and earnest and devious as a child; witty and earnest as a sixty-year-old, but much crankier, and though she retains her spirit, she has lost the deviousness which made her younger self a delight.  Case in point:  When a loud neighbor and competitor moves in, her strategies to combat him are downright ordinary, exactly what youth would expect of the rigid elderly.  Her triumph is the sort of thing I can see my grandmother sitting in her living room telling to her elderly friends, while they nod in agreement.  ""And >I< told HIM...""
Some of the reviews seem appalled that the younger Framboise went to such measures to torment her ""poor"" mother.  Poor nothing!  Framboise fought back in what was an intolerable environment.  By the end of the novel one can see her mother does care about her children (though unable to show it) and has her own problems, but one is still hard-pressed not to root for Framboise and her siblings in the situation.
I do have to agree with one reviewer and say kudos to Paul for sticking around the whole time, though I can't see why he does.  Framboise is fortunate he does.
All in all, a great character sketch of the lesser parts of being human.  And the ending made me want to put down the book and go on in denial, making up my own ending and pretending it was the real one -- but that's good, it means it's powerful.  Sad is more powerful than happy."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I sampled the book, then bought it. I found Scott Adams insights and experience match what I've seen work.

I marked it up for my youngest son, just starting out as an adult. Then I bought two more copies - one for oldest son, and another to replace mine. Adams' style is accessible and clear.

A few key takeaways:

- Use systems, not goals
- Try not to sell your time due to limited upside; your time is finite and limited
- Try to find a product that is infinitely scalable, that you can sell again and again (Intellectual Property might be one way)
- Piecing together complementary skills can make you _very_ much more effective
- Look to maximize your personal energy - the foundation of all else

The above are all key enablers for someone starting off. Scott Adams lays out a system to effectively experiment your way to personal success.

The set assembles fairly easily and for the most part stays together.  We use it more as a decoration to store her ponies on the shelf nicely. Since it is so flat, the ponies can go in front of it.

Books_5,1.0,OR,"I hate to give one star to any book but this was really awful. Perhaps the story would have been better if I didn't have to stumble through considerable editing difficulties. Whoever was in charge of this department at Warner books should have been fired. My copy is the first edition and there were numerous punctuation problems. So much so that it detracted from the story. I have never, I repeat never, read a book with this many mistakes. Willa Hammer headed west after losing her adopted family. Settling in the Bighorn Mountains she comes upon various melodramatic characters that think only of themselves. One of the characters just grated on my nerves. You'll know who it is without naming names. Smith Bowman, the hero, is a loner in many ways. When he meets Willa he is leery of her at first. In denial, he doesn't want to admit to himself that he is attracted to her. It scares him. Of course, we know how the story ends. If you find another edition without all the mistakes AND if hokey language doesn't bother you, you may like this romance.

Anyway, I am currently sitting amongst the parts of this thing trying to figure how the heck to put it together bc these are the worst instructions I've ever seen!! And I put together a much larger cat tree earlier this year.

For example, the instructions simply tell you you should have 8 lg sisal posts. What they don't decipher is that there are actually 6 of one size and two slightly smaller ones. And of the larger ones, several are weighted. It doesn't tell you which to use where. I'm going to assume the heavily weighted ones go on the bottom...

The pics in the instructions are also horrible. They are blurry and unclear. Still trying to figure out which is a base. I'm just going to look at a full color pic and wing it.

Update: I got it ""put together."" It's in quotes because I think the one piece is broken because it won't stay connected. And parts are missing from the catnip toy station. Very frustrating... There are two 'catnip stations' which are basically a hanging fuzzy ball surrounded by plastic tubes so it looks like a little cage. I am missing six of those tubes so I can't put the other catnip station on. Which means there is no stabilization there. And even the one I did add... as soon as the cats touch it, it will just pop off. Nothing really keeps it together!

And I think there need to be more longer screws. They expect you to use the shorter screws in parts where it doesn't work. I am sorry I bothered with this one. Mistake..."

Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"I put this on a large 6 month old kitten, who is already quite muscular, but with all the litheness of a kitty with especially slick, longish hair. I successfully put smaller versions on two smaller kittens, who did not have the strength to object quite so vigorously. This is another drawback of this rig. If the cat gets in in his head that he does not want this gizmo put on him, it becomes very difficult to attach it. Two grown men, both with good histories with wrangling cats, tried to put this rig on my 6 month old male, and it was quite a chore. There are two clips which fasten beneath the cat's tummy, which are so small, it becomes very difficult for a normal adult to open them. It is also difficult to connect the two halves, when they are laying against a cat with moderately long fur, which insists on getting in the way. These noisome connections are at the most inconvenient location, when a single person has to hold down an uncooperative kitty, and connect them at the same time. You need four hands at least.

So, that is two strikes against this design for large, energetic cats. After two grown men believed they had successfully harnessed our feline Houdini, he wriggled out of it in about 2 minutes. One second it was on, and the next, it was off. It was that fast. Makes me want to go into business to design a better kitty harness."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Nalini Singh certainly writes these books at a good pace. This is the fifth in the series, following 'Slave to Sensation' (September 2006), 'Visions Of Heat' (March 2007), 'Caressed By Ice' (September 07) and 'Mine To Possess' (February 2008), so she's managing to churn out two per year. I suppose this is on a par with many other authors but, having finished 'Hostage to Pleasure', I wonder if this author with her original ideas is perhaps a slight victim of her success.

'Hostage to Pleasure' was a good read. We had a varied cast of characters as always (shapeshifters including leopards, wolves and even rats), the Psy (Mr Spock-like beings who communicate telepathically) and occasional references to humans. We have characters who have their own bad memories, demons, difficulties, fears and a central love story which shows two people growing together and learning to gain strength from each other. Unfortunately for this reader at least the story felt a bit tired. Somehow I never quite felt I connected with Dorian Christensen, latent leopard shapeshifter and member of Lucas's pack, or with Ashaya Aleine, Psy scientist whose conditioning is not only fracturing but who may have never been properly conditioned anyway. It doesn't seem like a great deal actually happens in this story and for those who haven't read the previous books the cast of characters is fairly large and might get confusing. I was less than convinced by Ashaya's sister Amara and the ways in which the two interacted (and I also found the similarity of the names confusing at times).

Nalini Singh's worldbuilding continues in this novel with more about the council and another group, Pure Psy, which didn't always feel particularly connected to this story. I like the author's Psy/Changeling world but I found this book rather forgettable and nowhere near as good as 'Caressed by Ice'. It's a good read, worth the four stars, but not as good as some of the others."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Nine years ago, Alex Delaware successfully treated Melissa Dickinson, a tormented and phobic young girl, irrationally scared of almost everything. After two years of treatment, Melissa seems almost totally recovered, so her need for Dr Delaware ceases, and she becomes one of his most spectacular triumphs. Now, Melissa contacts Alex again, this time seeking advice concerning her mother. Gina Dickinson is a recluse, an ex-actress hiding away from the world ever since a vicious acid attack that left her scarred for life, even after extensive and traumatic plastic surgery. Even though Gina is now seeing, with some effect, a psychiatrist of her own, Melissa wants to know if Alex feels her mother could cope if she went away, accepting her place Harvard. Then, one day, Gina inexplicably climbs into her car, and drives off into thin air, leaving a tangled mystery to be unravelled in her wake.
I had started to think that this series was in danger of going stale. The prose is adequate and easy to read, but hardly full of spirit and at times seems a little perfunctory, and Alex Delaware has also remained a rather static - if very likeable - character. But now, after reading Kellerman's excellent standalone ""The Butcher's Theatre"", I returned to the series with ""Private Eyes"", and found it a wonderfully invigorating experience. This may be his lone of his longest Delaware books to date, but every word is fascinating, and there seems to me to be fresh fire in the writing. The characters are all very well developed, and although Kellerman never really takes any risks with his well-structured plot, it's a complex and clever book that really kicks the brain into gear, and presents one or two nice surprises along the way.
The psychology is dead-on, the relationships are all fascinating, the characterisation is acute, and the resolution is exciting, well-done, and satisfying. This may well turn out to be the rock of the Delaware series. To find out, i shall have to read on..."

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"This documentary is in my opinion a valuable expose of the credit card industry's ""back room"" techniques to get us consumers in debt and keep us there.  It shows the methods credit collection agencies use to get people to pay, and how those who are the least able to support a lot of debt in their lives are the most profitable people for credit card companies to get hooked into going into dept.  I learned a lot, and I think most anyone would benefit from seeing this documentary.

The two problems I had with this documentary were as follows:

First, it seems that all the average people (bankrupt or near-bankrupt consumers) interviewed in this film were portrayed as victims of the credit card industry, with no question as to how responsible or irresponsible these people might have been.  The bottom line is that credit card companies make people poor, keep them poor, and of course President Bush played right into their hands by championing the recently passed revisions to US bankruptcy laws.

The second problem I had was that although there is no narration, there are black slides with white text, and for some reason the editors picked a very hard to read font design and used it to create tiny paragraphs in the middle of a mostly black screen.  Not only that, the slides aren't up there very long, so be ready to hit the pause button on your remote so you can read the narration.

So, this documentary is worth a watch, if the price is right."

The movement of the two switches is so flimsy and floppy, I can't image this thing will last anywhere close to my dead Leviton, which we had for nearly ten years before one of the rockers got jammed. While the rockers on this Baomain switch have some play in the ON direction and eventually require some effort to turn the switches on, in the OFF direction it takes very little effort to turn it off. When ON, only a slight tap causes the switch to turn OFF. I didn't bother wasting my time installing it, and instead went to my local hardware store and got a Leviton switch. Bummer, because I was very excited to save half off of my future switch purchases. Oh well; buyer be warned."

Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"When Callan Carrigans father leaves the ranch to Court McAllister, Callan is shocked to say the least. For years she had worked alongside her father to keep the ranch running smoothly and it has been her home and her life. She also discovers letters to her and her sisters from her late mother that bring news that change their worlds. While Callan fights to regain some amount of control over her life, Court lends his not only his supportive hands but also makes a proposal that could give Callan some resemblance of her old life.

I absolutely loved the characters, especially that of Callan and her sisters. They share such a cool bond and are really close and understanding. Callan emerges as this strong girl who is used to running a ranch and confident that she can continue to do so on her own after her fathers death. At the same time she has this feminine quality about her that is really attractive. Court on the other hand, at first at least, feels a little bit of an outsider. He is handsome and sexy and understanding. However, I really did not get their relationship. There wasn't much interaction between them, let alone courtship yet they end up in each others arm. For me it was like two strangers professing their love for each other.

The plot had some twists which were a welcome change from the usual romance novels. Courts background and Callans mothers letters provided some additional depth to the book. However, the letters written by Callans mother felt too clinical in nature and lacked the warmth of a mother. The letters read like appointment letters rather than a letter from a mother to her children, especially with the news it delivers, one would expect some emotional words.

C.J Carmichael is one of my favourite romance authors, but this book disappointed me a lot."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is the epic story of one woman's journey to find knowledge and understanding about her own life but also for the world we live in. The book is beautifully written with dozens of unique characters that she meets during the eighty plus years of her life. The book actually starts with her dad as a young boy as he moves from humble origins in England to become one of the richest men in America by utilizing his knowledge of Botany to make profits. But, the book is much more than this. This book covers a full range of human emotions from humor to intense sorrow  - but what ties this book together is the heroine's quest for knowledge and understanding. I recommend this book in particular to people who have an innate sense of curiosity about the wondrous world we live in."

The criticism that it will not work well for small batches is totally wrong. I've been using it, on a regular basis, to make single loaves of bread for 40 years. This is an idea that has been spread by people who own a Kitchen Aid mixer. It is just not true! And all the attachments including the blender, food processor, juicer, grinder work beautifully."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This book is different from any story I ever read. While it starts as a regular suspense, it soon turns into a grabbing thriller where the emotion and suspense escalate with every page. I had trouble putting it down as I followed the tribulations of the heroine Dorrie. Morgan Mandel does a great job at keeping us turning the pages as we discover Dorrie's problems and wonder how she will react. The villains are great too, each with a convincing motivation to explain their actions. This is the first book in a series and we can't wait for the others."

Fair warningyou will need a copy of the book in order to read this book. While I read this book, I found myself saying, ""I think this is a pretty good book"" and then ""I wonder how it will end"" as I read it. I received a free copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review. This is a good book for a quick read. I love the characters and the story line. The characters are very well developed and the plot is well developed. This is a well written book. You will not be disappointed. I really enjoyed this book. I read it in a day, I found it interesting and I couldn't put it down. I didn't like how it was labeled. It was a little too much for me."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This book was most definitely five stars for me because I have loved Adam since the very first book of the series. Adam is so passionate and such a dominant that he protects all the women in his life. All the women he cares about. And he doesn't take no for an answer.
I had to write the author and tell her that I'm so excited for the very next book. At the very end of Adam, enough said, I hope that the two people that are discussed at the party are the next book I think that would be absolutely wonderful.

Summertimes over so I won't call this a beach read. I would say this book is definitely one that you could curl up with a nice blanket some hot chocolate, apple cider, or smooth Scotch and enjoy the read."

I've heard great things about this book, but I'm not sure if it's because it's geared more towards fiction or if it's meant for a broader audience.  I'm sure it's a great book for a wide range of audiences.  I'd recommend it to anyone who loves fiction.  I think it's worth reading.I was given the opportunity to read this book for my class and I had no idea what I was reading. It was very informative and I'm happy to say that it is not what I expected.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"First off, I think the cover for outlaw is fabulous!  After Reaper's Property, my friend and have been looking for other books about the MC lifestyle.  While Cole is VP of the Outlaws, he is hardly a bad ass biker, but I still loved the character.

Cole is a biker with a conscience, he sees Angel in trouble at another club's party and feels the need to help her.  Poor Angel is just in the wrong place at the wrong time, her situation is bad and she is definitely saved from worse by Cole.

These two spend 9 days together, living, learning and having fun, until the floor drops out from under them.  Cole then has to decide what he wants to do with the rest of his life and Angel has to decide if she even wants Cole in hers anymore.

I think the book was well written and I liked the story line, it was a little slow from the get go, then the drama ensues.  It wasn't a gritty biker romance, but a good romance just the same."

They come with a mesh carrying case, though I usually use an enclosed bag when I take them to the gym so they don't drip all over the floor. They fit true to size- they are just snug enough to stay on my feet without being difficult to put on or take off. I usually put them on my feet when I am already in the pool and have had no problems using one hand to slip them on. They do definitely make a difference in my swimming speed. I am a casual swimmer and swim mostly for exercise at the gym. These have increased my lap time pretty significantly and allow me to swim faster without getting so worn out."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"This historical thriller revolves around the Earl of Walden and his family, who all become involved in a life and death struggle the outcome of which could have a serious influence on World War 1.

Walden receives a visit from Churchill, asking for help negotiating with Russia about alliances in the forthcoming War.  Walden feels this is an exciting opportunity to further his career, whilst his Russian wife finds it brings back unwanted memories of a love she has tried to put behind her.  Meanwhile their daughter is busy thinking about being presented to the King and Queen and her first Season  whilst beginning to discover that the real world is not quite as her sheltered upbringing has led her to believe.

Alongside the family activities in London and at their country estate,  the suffragettes are fighting for womens rights, a Russia anarchist has arrived to assassinate the Russian delegate Walden is negotiating with, and interesting discussions are being held on the moving of European boundaries to satisfy political needs.

I found this book disappointing.  The writing style, as usual with Ken Follett, is excellent, and the story moves along at a steady pace.  However I never found myself particularly interested in the main characters.  Many of the historical detail from that time are fascinating ; the social norms of aristocratic women, the suffragettes and the political upheavals going on.  So, its a nice easy read, with interesting background information."

It is a story about a man who had a baby, a woman who had a child, a man who had a wife, and a woman who had a son.

First let me say I am a Kershaw, Zero Tolerance type of guy, but I have seen so many people rave about Spyderco that I decided to take a look at the Tenacious. Some consider this to be one of the top EDC blades under $50 bucks. So what the hell I pulled the trigger and got one.

Man I am glad I did, the feel of this baby is sweet, the ergonomics of the knife is excellent and it just fits my hands like a glove. It's really a good size for EDC pocket carry and it feels extremely light to me while it's in my pocket and in my hand. I really like the G10 handles, good sturdy gripping. The jimping feels really good and the blade locks up great. No wiggle or movement what so ever. I will update this review after I carry a little more, but so far I am super pumped up about it.

I am really glad I purchased this knife, they say this knife is the ""Entry Drug"" for the Spyderco brand, I think they might be right!"

We actually had a bit of a scare in the middle of the night the other day, when Giselle was sleeping too close to the edge of her bed and accidentally fell to the floor. Luckily for us, we had this rug laid down so it helped tremendously to break her fall. It is very thick and cushioned, so she was able to brace the impact on her head and body! Ironic, but it we felt the rug was meant to be there for her.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,CG,"Spoilers: Not since Alien 3 has a movie with a third act gone wrong that a movie with a third act gone wrong had a movie with a third act gone wrong.  The result is that it's a little disappointing.  Some of the movie's dialogue and plot holes are almost laughable.  The only redeeming feature is the soundtrack.  There's a lot of music, but it's just not there.  I can't tell you how many times I've been so confused that I thought I'd never heard the music.  I know that I haven't.

But this movie has a lot of good stuff going on, and it's great to see a movie like this come out.  I'm not sure if it's because the writers are getting tired of having to write a story about a movie that's not even a good movie.  I'm just not sure if it's because the writers are tired of having to write a story about a movie that's not even a good movie.  If they did, they'd give it another shot.

If not, I'd be surprised if the movie didn't end up as a major disaster, but it's still a great movie.I love this series, the costumes and the music"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,The one's we received had the green light button on the right not the left as pictured.  Which turns out is exactly what we wanted.  So the picture seems to be mirrored left to right.  Works great though.  If you plan on using several you might want to make a chart of how you set the four dip switches.  When I was testing my handy work I switched the light on and off several times than sat down to rest.  The light then began flashing on and off on its own.  I was confused until my son came upstairs and told me his light was turning on and off.  Only then I realized I set both to the same code accidentally so it was turning on and off both lights.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Should fiction writers use Roget's Thesaurus? I've read and heard arguments on both sides. Those who say ""No"" think that writers using It write overblown prose, using a long word where a shorter one would be better.
I disagree. There are times when the first word that comes to mind is the easy word that does not get at the real meaning of a character's thought, or the feeling I want to convey. If I just write, ""the room was cold,"" I've shortchanged the reader. How cold and why does the temperature matter?  But if I show that people wear two pairs of thick wool socks just to sit inside, or get up three times in the night to make sure the baby's bed cap is on his head, or have another character remark that the mercury has frozen in the thermometer, the reader feels the cold.

This thesaurus is not only a word-finder that lets me locate synonyms to vary my writing vocabulary, it jogs my brain into new was of thinking about what I'm writing.

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,CG,PUCHASED AS A BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR MY 3 1/2 year old.  He loves to throw the ball around
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Michael Weiss and the other creators of this redux of the Jules Verne classic posit that someone who actually made the trip to the center of the earth through a volcanic tube told the story to Verne. In short, Trevor Anderson (Fraser) is a struggling geologist who has been trying for ten years to prove his brother Max's theory that the Jules Verne tale is real.  Trevor's inherited project is about to be closed down when his sister in law brings his 13-year-old nephew, Sean, (Hutcherson) to stay for a couple of days.

Along with Sean's baggage is a box of Max's things, including his hand-annotated version of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" Based on Max's notes, Trevor realizes that his brother actually was close to proving his theories before he disappeared. Coincidentally, the geological conditions are perfectly matched to those under which Max died.

This brings Trevor and Sean to Iceland, where Max was last seen.  They hire mountain guide, Hannah (Briem),  who was also the daughter of another Vernian, to take them up the mountain to one of Max's monitoring sites.

Through a freak accident, they end up falling through a cave down into the center of the earth.  Thus, their journey to return begins.  You will see elements of the threats from the original novel--in 3D if your theatre supports it.  Much of the film is a wild ride with vestiges of ""Temple of Doom"" style mine shafts and water slides that will leave you gasping.

The 3D effects are pretty stunning, which is probably the best part of the film with a few touching scenes included between Trevor and Sean.  Overall, seeing the remake was a satisfying experience intensified by the special effects.

Note:  Due to 3D, my theatre had a surcharge for the glasses which made the matinee price of the film close to $[...].

Warning:  Those with vertigo, migraines, seizures or other motion-triggered illnesses might want to use caution in seeing this film.

It's very compact; smaller than I'd expected, but not with keys too tight together either.  It's also a little heavier than I expected, which is good because it doesn't skid on the desk.  Very efficient use of space.  The space bar works great no matter where it's hit, despite what one review said."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Main reason I purchased this was to ""flesh-out"" my new computer case.  My newly built PC (from Amazon purchased parts) has two USB 3.0 ports in the back, but the motherboard has an additional 2 port header for front panel ports.  My case came equipped with two front-panel USB 2.0 ports but no USB 3.0 ports.  Since I didn't need a floppy drive in the 3.5"" outer drive bay, I purchased this hub.  It has the additional benefit of having the ""FAST CHARGE"" option on the fourth port.  I tested this out with my Samsung Galaxy S5 (with the phone's USB 3.0 cable) and confirmed that in Fast-Charge mode, the PC will charge my phone just as fast as the Samsung S5 charger, or in half the time of a USB 2.0 port or 1000 mA or less charger."

While trying to find my size, I discovered that Silver's official website offers a generic sizing chart, but trying to estimate my exact size was difficult based on the limited information. Anyway, my new 36 x 34 Silver jeans arrived from Amazon and were exactly what I had in mind in terms of color and style. (These jeans look exactly as they do in the pictures on Amazon). However, I immediately noticed after trying them on that these jeans were way too large on me--in the waist, thigh, and leg. I checked the tag and noticed that the jeans are made from 99% cotton and 1% elastane, which means there is a slight amount of stretch in the material. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly made the jeans feel overly baggy. I ordered another pair exactly like the first, but in size 34 x 34. Amazon sent the replacement pair in a scant three days! The new jeans fit perfectly, look great, and are not too tight. Also, the inseam length (34) was appropriate with other 34 inseamed jeans that I wear. If you are looking for a pair of trendy jeans, these are perfect.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I first got a Polar H7 to help me maintain my heart rate zones while cycling and get somewhat more accurate calorie counts. It was a headache nearly the entire time I owned it. While I believe owning a heart rate monitor is one of the best things you can buy to help with your fitness, I wouldn't recommend the H7. The TICKR is everything the H7 isn't. It is reliable, connects fast, lets you know it's working (via the lights) and supports both ANT+ and bluetooth, so it's like 2 products in one. Also, the way it connects makes it slightly easier to put on, in my opinion. The H7 would work fine for weeks, then have problems connecting for a few weeks, then be fine again. To get it to connect I'd have to unpair and repair, sometimes repeatedly. It had trouble with my iPhone 5 and iPhone 6, and with multiple apps (polar app, cyclemeter, wahoo app, others). The TICKR connects every time, instantly. I never have to wait for it. In case I'm worried that it isn't connected, the lights let me know it's working. But, I never worry that it isn't connected, because it ALWAYS WORKS. Unlike the H7. My experience with Wahoo support with other products leaves me confident that if I do have issues, they'll help me out quickly and with little fuss. My only gripe is that the strap is a bit less comfortable than the Polar strap. The plastic bit in the back can press directly into your skin, and the HRM itself comes into contact with your skin. It would be nice if the only thing that touched your skin was the soft strap. Oh well, it's still the best HRM you can buy."

I love Dorian's attitude, he loves his cognate, Cora Shaw, and he basically thinks of everything, even what should happen to him should he 'die'. He seduces Cora and makes love like an expert, hot dang! Then there is the storyline, suspense, intrigue, drama, characters, romance, and sex...sigh... The only thing I don't like is the cliffhangers, so my suggestion is to buy the bundle. You won't regret it."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this or not - a mix of Tudor history and fantasy/magic? I was pleased to find that it was excellent, and I read it in two days!

The author clearly knows her subjects very well indeed, which always makes such a difference. The history itself is detailed and accurate, and I very much liked the accounts of the day to day domestic life of the period. I'm fascinated by the thought of possible alternative lives, and the idea of what might have happened had Henry VIII believed his wife Anne Boleyn over the accusations of her enemies is an intriguing one. Of course all events have a butterfly's wing effect, and Ms Taylor imagined the fates of other members of the Tudor court very cleverly. The politics of the day are very well described, too; how quickly, in those dangerous and turbulent times, one could fall from favour...

I am not usually one for magic/fantasy novels, but this element of the story was most convincing; it made me think of a more grown up and serious Hogwarts! I wonder how much of it was just the author's imagination and how much was taken from the beliefs and practices of the time; I imagine it's a combination of the two. I particularly liked the parts about numerology and the breaking of codes; oddly enough I was only watching a TV programme last night about the use of codes in secret communications during Elizabethan times, and Ms Taylor has all this spot on. To sum up, the fusing of history with fantasy is very successful, and I shall definitely be reading the next book in the series before too long. I think it would appeal to anyone interested in the Tudor period, and to those who enjoy reading believable fantasy."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"You ever get sick of having to pay top dollar for a rechargeable battery? I know I do. But that is the reality and I am not willing to have to buy a whole new drill rig because it seem more economically feasible to do so instead of buying a battery that is about half the cost.

Well with this Pwr+ second market battery you don't have to any longer. After getting a case of sticker shock at the local Home Depot for a replacement battery for my DeWalt drill I thought there had to be options. There are and I found it right here.

Now there are multiple batteries available on Amazon for the DeWalt drill. So, how did I settle on this Pwr+ battery. I spent some time reading the product reviews and ultimately found that this particular aftermarket brand had high ratings and pleased customers that stated the battery not only charged well, but lasted as well.

For less than $30, I purchased this battery and received it within two days. (I have Amazon Prime). It charged and worked as I expected it to. You cannot go wrong with this battery and it has served me well thus far."

There are four sets of armies to chose from gold and green are the Alliance of Elves and Men while red and black are the armies of Mordor.  The this version of risk adds in generals, strongholds and the fellowship of the ring movie along to Mount Doom; all of these can be optional of course.  Generals and strongholds add one to the players highest roll, so if you are defender being attacked and you territory has a stronghold in it then your 6 becomes a 7.  If you are an attacker and have a general in the territory you are attacking from then your 6 becomes a 7.  Now the playing with the fellowship of the ring then they begin in Shire and move you terroritory per turn till they reach Mount Doom.  If the fellowship lands in a terroritory controled by the forces of Mordor then they can roll to capture the fellowship and thus win the game, but if the fellowship reaches Mount Doom then the forces of Mordor loose.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1.0,OR,"I can only blame myself for not looking through the negative reviews on this bra. Everything that people said is true.
The bra is cheap looking from thin cotton fabric. Really not intended for sizes bigger than C cup. Also might be uncomfortably tight for sizes over 36.  I ordered XL (I'm 38D -38DD) and this is definitely way too small. It's also uncomfortable tight around my chest so no way I can wear it at night.
For the poor quality it's clearly overpriced as well. I feel fooled by trusting Medela brand to have some understanding of a breastfeeding woman's anatomy.
The return policy is not mentioned anywhere and I made another mistake trusting that it would be something similar to amazon's - i.e, free return on clothing that is in unused condition. Well, silly of me. There is a 20% re-stocking fee, plus you have to pay shipping costs. Together this will come for me to about 7-8$ at least, half of the bra's price. Not to mention that I'll have to find time to go to the post office to send it (not something you are looking forward to when you just had a baby). Otherwise why would you shop online if you can go to the store to find bra that fits?
While I understand the reasons behind the return policy on things bought from a third party through Amazon, I wish I was better informed about it before I spent money on this bra."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"These sorts novels rest a lot on believable characters. The problem with Florida novels is that real living characters in Florida often eclipse any fictional characters for stupidity, corruption and evil intent. This is the state that attracts serial killers, Koran burning ministers, scammers and con artists, and whose main reputation in other states for monumental zaniness. Here Randy Wayne White has created a sane grounded, and admirable character. Most importantly he doesn't make her a superwomen, kung fu warrior. She's brave and tough and smart, but she makes mistakes in a dangerous situation that are both human and suspenseful. The sort that anyone placed in a highly stressful situation would make. My complaint about a lot of writers in this genre is their characters are too masterful and unbelievable and you can lose interest in them easily. The second part that I liked about this is its a tightly plotted ""little"" story that deals with evil and takes us on a little journey through west florida and the thousand islands. And that too makes it very readable. The challenge for Randy White is that of a male trying to write in the first person about a female. I think it's extremely difficult to do. And I think the author does a good job of this. But not quite. Which is why I gave it 4 stars rather than five. It could be that as a fan I could not forget the male Doc of his other novels, and I had the odd sensation of the marine biologist sort of springing out in drag sometimes. I'm pretty much convinced though that this is more my fault than the authors. If you are a fan read this one. It's even better if you are new to his fiction. It's great, and a new start, for White. I think Hanna, as a fishing guide, and cracker descendent, will be able to go places that the good Doctor can't quite find."

I have sent text pix to insomniac friends to prove he will line them up precisely 6"" apart and equidistant from the rug edges. They look at the time stamps.
I wonder what evolutionary predatory advantage the placement confers?? I am just glad that Amazon has these. They are getting harder and harder to find in the original texture/size.
Hmmm....he sure does, ahem, lose these a lot!?! I wonder where they go??
He does like new ones that are kitty fuzz free (now he knows how we feel; oh, I guess their prey is hairy...not his concern..).

Books_5,4.0,OR,"You know what I loved about this book?  I never had to forgive the hero or the heroine for being an idiot.  Not once did they betray each other. Not once did they fail to forgive a shortcoming.  There was no subterfuge, no great misunderstanding.  It's just a story of a man, trying to win a woman's heart --and succeeding.

Margaret is firmly on the shelf at 30 when her brother inherits a Dukedom.  He decides to share his good fortune with his sister, offering a sizable dowry for her to finally snag a husband.  That money is just what Rhys needs.  But when he meets Margaret, he is taken with her quick wit and strong will... and he knows they would be a perfect fit.

Margaret wants a man to love her for more than the money her brother is offering.  And Rhys' financial problems are no secret, so it takes some time before she is assured of his affections.  But the sexual tension is good and when they finally come together, it's great.  There are a few foils for the couple along the way, but they're all external.  It's a short read... only a little over 100 pages... but a pleasant way to spend an afternoon.  4 stars."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I love sports romance, but hockey romance is by far my favorite! I now have read all seven of these fabulous Carolina Cold Fury Hockey romances and I have loved them all for different reasons. They all have different types of twists to each of them. Now I have a new favorite, Roman! I loved it and flew through the pages!

I am not going to rehash the story for you as the synopsis gives you a good set up of what the book is about. There is drama. there are steamy love scenes between Lexi and Roman, but it is a slow build with lots of flirting and innuendos and they are so sweet together. It is wonderful to see how their growing infatuation turns into a deep caring relationship.

The new twist to this book is there is a concurrent love story developing between Brian Brannon (Lexis father that she recently found out about from her dying mother) and Lexis free spirited boss Georgia! Lets just say Georgia really knew how to loosen up that stuck-up suit! Another twist is the family dynamics between Brian, Lexi and her half-sister, Gray. Gray had a hard time adjusting to the idea of sharing her father (Brian). Gray, as general manager of the Cold Fury, had issues with Roman and his personal and professional trouble making ways. Roman didn't like her management style, so they agreed to disagree and their disdain for one another put Lexi in a bad position; choose between her new family or the man she was falling in love with.

If you love sports romance that has a bit of drama, fun banter, steamy scenes, touching moments, and crazy secondary characters, then give this book a try. You won't regret it!"

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I am not a movie reviewer.  You may like it and you may not.  Once I caught on to the plot, I enjoyed it.  Part of the plot has to do with Celtic (pagan) rituals vs Christianity.  This may bother the very devout Christians as it did the lead character.  On the other hand, this movie is very well thought of in England and according to one movie group, is considered the 6th best movie made in England.  It comes close to being as popular as Rocky Horror Picture Show and I can imagine people lining up at midnight to see this movie and well prepared to sing along.  After all, it is a musical horror movie with no blood.  Do you want to hear a young Christopher Lee sing?"

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"The Birthday Supplies Kit is such a great idea and will cover your bases for any small (8 or fewer) people at a birthday party. The kit includes what you need for eating & drinking--plates, napkins, cups and plastic cutlery, as well as the decorations--tablecloth, small centerpiece, balloons, streamers and curling ribbon. Oh yeah, and 12 candles!! My tablecloth is the cute panda table cloth, not red like the photo. It's actually much cuter and matches the plates and napkins in design. The whole setup looks great, buttoned up and complete.

In my experience with birthday parties, if you were having more kids than 8, it would be more affordable and less wasteful to supplement this set with extra plates & forks than to buy a second set. And most kids don't ever touch their napkins... Don't forget the hand wipes though, always good to have on hand.

This set is so useful and saved me a trip to the store, time and gas. If you got this stuff at Target, it would be so much more expensive too. However, this same stuff at the Dollar Store would only total $10-13 (plus tax if applicable) if you bought this ala carte. It could be extra from the extra cutlery. Anyway, I love this set and totally appreciate how it saved me time and money and left nothing behind."

The zip on lunch bag is a great idea for those of us who look like Hannibal crossing the Alps when we go to work. The lunch bag is big enough for a cold pack and my modest lunch. It might make the load ungainly if you overload the lunch bag.

Not a lot of bells and whistles here otherwise; there is a side pocket for a water bottle. This pack is a little small for day to day commuting for me but will get a lot of weekend use. I think it would be perfect for older school kids and simplify their morning routine. The colors of my pack are significantly different than the photo of the dot pattern."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"The Taotronics Bike Phone Mount Bicycle Holder is a great peace of engineering, that is very versatile. Prior to buying the phone mount holder I placed my phone in a bum bag, when riding my road bike. The Taotronics phone mount holder has enabled me to change all this. Now my phone is mounted on my handle bars in front of me. During my 40km rides ""DownUnder"" (Sydney, Australia), where at times the ride can get rather bumpy, my phone sits securely clamped and strapped to the phone mount holder on my handle bars. I find it so much easier to use my phone when riding. Also, it is easier to listen to the feedback on my riding performance during my ride, from the downloaded app on my phone. This phone mount was purchased on 15th March 2017 and my wife was so impressed with it, she wanted one for her bike, which was purchased on 25th May 2017. The recommendation from the seller, to use the rubber strap before you put the holder part and the clamp together on the handle bars, was taken heed of. I recommend both the Taotronics Phone Mount Holder and seller Sunvalleytek. Regards Stephen."

Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"Okay first off this is not a LOSi product quality bash review because we all know LOSI makes quality cars. This is just my first impression of this particular car for anyone interested in getting one this size for the first time. When I first held the car in my hand I knew that this size scale was not for me at all. For the money it felt very cheap and the controller felt even worse. But that was okay because I was going to keep it anyways for fun around the house on a rainy day. that was until i charged up the battery, got everything hooked up, pulled the trigger. nothing. Apparently i got a bad controller because the car would only move after i pulled the trigger more than once forward and backwards to get it moving and once it did the car just took off and once it stopped same problem again. After about 10 minutes of this i gave up and sent it back. Like i said it just wasn't for me but that does not mean it's not for someone else. The cool thing about this car is that it's a hobby grade car which means you can upgrade it with metal parts and better upgrades if you wish. So if your willing to spend the money to do that then by all means buy the car and have fun with it."

Also, the switch is next to the plug which means that to turn it off, you have to get down to the outlet where it's plugged in! Not very convenient.

I did appreciate details that weren't in the textbooks of the 1990's like union strikes and monopoly dealings and a greater emphasis on race relations in mining and Native American dealings (more history being revealed) but over all I found the book a bit boring and strangely organized and lacking in depth.-- It jumps too fast post 1900 onward.--It seems to be cramming more history into the same length of textbook these days is their solution to the problem of more and more history being revealed, but I found it more of a problem. 2.5 stars."

First Impression: Well-written, engaging, expertly executed, and FUN, a book after my heart. Chloe is a software analyst who works from home and only allows herself to truly experience lifeand sexwhen she goes to comic conventions, dressed in sexy cosplay costumes that give her the carefree confidence she lacks in her day to day life. She likes the role play a lot because she feels brave in the costumes, more in control of herself and her needs. It's at one of the conventions she goes to that she meets Grant Osprey and though they didn't share their real names, they did share a night together. A night Grant would like to repeat, despite the fact that his convention lover turns out to be his friend and business partner's little sister. Oops. I freaking loved this book! It's a quick, fast-paced read that immediately caught my attention and held me captive throughout my reading. Maybe it's the author's easy, seemingly effortless writing style, or maybe it's my own experiences with going to comic conventions and being amazed by all the costumes--a few of which my own niece has designed and worn, but I instantly fell in love with Chloe and Grant's story because I could relate to them on a very real scale. Which made for such a fun and enjoyable read for me. If you love stories of forbidden love with fun, sexy role play between two well-drawn characters who will positively mesmerize you, Playing For Her Heart by Megan Erickson is an excellent read by an extremely talented author."

I got the rawhide forty color. The leather is a dark, subtle reddish brown. It's also very stiff and smooth at first, but develops large visible folds/wrinkles very quickly - I think this just adds character to the boot. I can wear these with just about anything.

The sizing is tricky. I'm normally a 7.5 (sometimes 7) and I've never needed a wide width. After reading reviews, I chose a 7 wide, which fit almost perfectly (it's just a little narrow still). So, I think this boot runs slightly long and very narrow. I also have some difficulty getting my feet in them - even with the zipper open, the entrance is a bit too small - but this isn't a huge issue either.

Overall, I really like the boot because it's versatile, cute, and seems very sturdy. I'm just deducting a star because it's not particularly comfortable or easy to get on - but again, maybe those things will improve as the leather breaks in."

It's easy to clean, and he doesn't have to worry about getting the harness tangled up in his chest. It's not a big deal, but it's a nice extra-large size for him. I have two dogs.

I'm not sure if the metal is heavy or if it's not.  I'd suggest getting one of the smaller plastic covers.  They are very sturdy and feel very durable.  The case is a good size, and it has a nice feel to it.  The only complaint I have is that it does not come with a case for the Micro USB 3.0 ports.  I don't know if that is the case or if the plastic covers are just too small, but I have not tried the case yet.  I would definitely recommend this product.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,"When a sump pump goes bellyup it usually happens when you need it most. Which means you can't wait for shipping or shop price, you head to the hardware store and pay top buck. After numerous Wayne pump float switches died (usually just after the warranty expires)I saw this one with the Switch Genius technology. At 3/4 HP it was more pump than I needed and it was the most expensive sump pump I ever bought. But I figured if the switch was more reliable than float switches the piece of mind would be worth the money.

I noticed the switch cycles the pump on early and shuts off only after sucking air for 10 - 15 seconds. After some severe storms a few weeks later I came home from work and could smell something hot. The pump wasn't turning off and was hotter than blazes! After following the manual and cleaning off the sensor it still wouldn't shut off. After unplugging the pump for half an hour or so it appeared to work normally again. Every time there's a storm I have trouble with the water sensor not shutting off the pump. Wayne says to send it back for a replacement on my dime. It weighs a ton and is going to be expensive to ship. Plus, what do I do for a pump while there's two in transit?

I had a Zoeller pump for over ten years with no problems until the switch died. I had to go with Waynes because that's what the hardware store carried and like I said, when you need a replacement you usually need it in a hurry. I've gone through 5 Wayne pumps in 6 years, this will be the last."

I make batter and dough in it effortlessly several times a week. We eat Paleo/gluten free, so I make most all muffins, cookies, cakes & breads from scratch. We even make homemade Lara bars in seconds!

The preprogrammed buttons apply to most everything you would want to do.

A Spatula can scrape out under the blades and get out every last bit (unlike Vitamix)

It fits under my kitchen cabinet (unlike Vitamix)

The blades are not sharp so no worry about you or your kids getting cut and they never dull (unlike Vitamix)

The recipe book is great a great guide for most anything you may want to do with this awesome blender!

8 year warranty and from what the rep (at Costco) said it's an easy process if needed

The best part may be the clean up. A cup or 2 of water and a few drops and let it rip. The cup is all one piece, so you don't have to take it apart to wash and then put it all back together again.

One thing to know in deciding between the 4-side and wild side cup, the wildside is bigger so makes more, but requires a bit more volume to work correctly, so if you want to make smaller smoothies or batches of batters you may prefer the 4 side cup."

I suspect the double  mezzalunas would do a better job of chopping, however, I read that the food would get stuck in between the blades and I could see that.  You would need to have blades that were spread further apart than I could find to solves that problem.  I read complaints on the cover however, I have no problem with the cover.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Carlos Ruiz Zafn's novel The Shadow of the Wind begins with a trip to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a vast, labyrinthine repository for books of all kinds. Daniel Sempere's father, a bookseller, cautions his son that he must never speak of what he sees to anyone--it's a great secret. Ten-year-old Daniel is allowed to choose a book for his very own, to be its protector and champion and rescue it from obscurity. A mysterious book called The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Carax catches his eye. He devours the book, but when he tries to find more books by Carax, he discovers that someone has mysteriously been burning all of Carax's works, and his copy of The Shadow of the Wind is one of the rarest books he will ever encounter. One day, Daniel is confronted by a man calling himself Lain Coubert, the devil in The Shadow of the Wind--the man who has been attempting to obliterate Carax's works from the literary landscape. Daniel feels compelled to learn more about Carax. As Daniel grows, his life begins to eerily mimic events in Carax's life.

The novel is an excellent mystery involving the obsession with reading and with true love. Jonathan Davis's reading is superb. If he is not a native Spanish speaker, he certainly sounds like one. The audio book kept me riveted. I looked forward to my commutes so that I could listen to the story unfold. If I have one complaint, it is that the audio version employs mood music. On the one hand, the music was a cue to listen carefully as something very important would be happening, but it needed to be modulated differently--sometimes I strained to hear Davis over the music. As with any audio book, it is hard to go back and easily re-read portions, which is something I really wanted to do as I listened to this book. The story itself can be somewhat hard to follow--it takes twists and turns. However, Zafn brought the streets of Barcelona alive. Anyone who loves books should enjoy The Shadow of the Wind."

The game play focuses on balancing the need to accomplish your own secret goal while actively trying to mislead your opponents to what that goal is.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Enthralling doesn't even begin to cover this book. Ms. Kelly's story-telling and writing style in this book was more than I could have hoped for. The story was exciting, hot, and hilarious. The plot had me staying up into the night to read longer than I should have. The female characters are strong and take no-nonsense from the alpha males in their lives. The snarky, sassy personalities had me laughing and at times cringing at their crazy, yet courageous acts. Willow is incredibly strong and doesn't hold back. This makes for, at times, a hilariously volatile interaction with Mal. Mal is your alpha male with an overprotective personality. Oh yeah they are complete opposites! I'm not sure which characters I loved more though. The secondary characters were almost as involved as the main characters and had me falling in love with them and solidifying my new addiction to this series. I'm now impatiently waiting for Book 2 and my next love match. Nothing better than a promise of more of my new loves being the center of their own books. If you haven't read this book you need to!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,Love this item. I smile every time I I use it
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"First - about sizing. The Amazon size choices for this item list many 'tall' sizes that the are not available on the NeoSport website.  The only 'tall' size offered by NeoSport is 'Large/Tall'.  So - even though I ordered an XLTall from Amazon I expected to get just an XL. That was OK with me since it is usually a sleeve length issue for me and since this item is a vest sleeve length did not matter. When the vest arrived it was tagged XLT (just like I ordered). I don't know why this item is available, from Amazon anyway, in sizes that the company does not advertise. I looked for other NeoSport items on Amazon that might come in 'tall' sizes but found none.
  About the vest...I am 6'4"" tall and have a 35"" waist and a 45"" chest and weigh 200#. The XLT fits me perfectly. A very snug fit but that is the way a wetsuit item should fit for best performance. It has a heavy duty zipper that is backed by a flap of fabric so you don't catch any chest hair on the way up and down. After paddling 4 hours this afternoon the zipper stayed in place without working its way down. The arm holes seem a little small but that adds to the effectiveness of the insulation qualities. I could feel the fabric at the arm holes while paddling but did not get any chafing. Next time out I will try wearing a lightweight wicking shirt under the vest just to see if it feels any different.
  This item is priced pretty closely with other items of its type, although some I have tried did not have the protective flap of fabric backing the zipper.
  If this thing falls apart on me I will try to edit this review but for now I am very pleased with this purchase."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"I originally returned this product, but I thought it would be better to make a small size one.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,CG,"1. This is a 3-speed-plus (i.e., you can't turn it on or off). It is so small that it's not worth the extra money you spend to get it plugged into your car. It's not waterproof, so it can't hold water for long.

It's a bit smaller than I expected it to be, but it's still a solid enough light. I just wish it came with a charger, which would have been nice.

Overall, this light is a great value. I would recommend this light to anyone who uses a lot of lights.Good quality, but not bright enough.  The soft white light appears to be a bit on the cheap side, but it does make up for it.  I would not recommend it for someone who has a lot of light, but it does look nice.  I would recommend this light for anyone who needs a very bright light.This is my second pair of these, and I really like the quality of the material and the design.  They are very easy to install, and the rubber part of the head is very easy to install, and I like that the head is completely enclosed.  They are very comfortable to wear, and have a nice feel to them.  I would recommend these for those who wear glasses, and for those who wear them in a tight space.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"I loved this cooker, but it inexplicably went dead in the middle of a cycle after just two years of light use.  Given the cost of the item, I am not pleased.  Worse, this failure occurred abruptly after a spendy repair to the steam valve.

Before the failure, I found the device to make reliable rice and risotto. Having perfectly cooked rice in six minutes is definitely a luxury. The browning function made the slow cook feature very convenient- we made several pot roasts and a lot of pulled pork in this.  It was also nice to be able to use the pressure setting as a sort of turbocharge for the slow cooker if things were dragging.

That said, the short shelf life is not the cooker's only failing.  The gasket is fiddly and doesn't always seal properly.  Dirt tends to collect in crevices and it can be difficult to clean.  Finally, the steam valve inexplicably shattered one day, and judging from the other reviews here, this is not an uncommon occurrence."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"This works great if you follow the instructions.  I like the bottle with the injector tip for applying the product more liberally to carpet.  I don't buy this small bottle though.  I buy the gallon bottle and refill the smaller bottles.  I had a dog with bladder stone issues and recurrent UTIs, so I had puddles from time to time.  Some were fresh, some had time to soak in.  Worked like a champ in both cases! This certainly worked better than Natures Miracle, IMHO.

The only glitch is that my toilet seat is now raised up from the front by about an inch and does not sit flush on the pot rim.

The HTC is adjustable to the nearest inch, making it a bit looser fit than the Delta (so, you still need some wood to shim your machine tight, or attach your tool to the stand).  I think the Delta would be harder to assemble if you didn't already have a drill press or some similar means of drilling a perfectly squared hole.  The rolling action of both is pretty comparable.  Overall, I'd probably choose this HTC over the Delta if I needed a third mobile base."

I can't wait to read the next one!I received a free copy of this book from the author for my honest review. This book was very interesting to me.

This was my first time reading the author's work and it was my first time reading the series.  I had a lot of fun with the characters and the storyline.  This was a good book and I enjoyed it a lot.  I would recommend this book to others.  I was given an ARC in exchange for an honest review.I liked this book so much I could not put it down! I love the characters and the story line! It's very realistic! I want to see more of the old school soldiers, but I'm not sure I want to read a story about a man who is so broken and confused that he doesn't know who to trust or care for. I love the fact that the author does not give the reader a definitive answer for what caused her to be so broken and confused. I look forward to reading more books by this author!

I received this book as a gift from the author.This is the first book I've read by this author and I'm glad I did.  She's done it again.  The story line is fast paced and flows very well.  I loved the characters and the story line.  It's not a short story but it's a great read.  I would recommend this book to everyone.I really enjoyed reading this book. It was well written and I really enjoyed the characters.  It was sweet and sexy.  I love the way the story flowed and the way the story progressed.  It was a fun read. "

First of all, this kite came packaged exceptionally well.  The entire kite is very impressive and includes everything you need, complete with a stunning kite, string (with a dispenser), directions, a spare cross piece, spare connectors,and a spare tail.  The kite looks stunning in the air, and even after a few dips and falls is holding strong.  Best of all, if a piece like a cross piece breaks, we have a spare.

 After having bad luck with kites in the past, I was nervous about trying another kite, but I'm so glad we did.  Finally, a kite we can enjoy, store nicely, and lasts more than a few times.  This kite will last for a long time, and even comes with an exceptional guarantee, the ""Sea-'n'Tree NO-LOSS Guarantee"".  Funny, but amazing!

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I have a very-sound sensitive 8 year old child (as in, have had to flee any fireworks, gun shots, or anything even mildly loud since she was a baby).  Having a set of earplugs (that can be put in by her unobtrusively) and a set of ear muffs (when she is too scared to be self conscious) is a sanity saver for all of us.

The small version fits her and her older sister perfectly, and is slightly small for my normal head sized-husband (way to small for giant-headed me).  But with an open floor plan, I think I am going to get some bigger versions to have around the house.  I realized they could be invaluable if the girls ever start humming tunes from Frozen when we are trying to read.

PROS:

Very comfortable (size small works for my kids, get larger for adults)
They (semi) collapse to a somewhat smaller size (though do not fold down completely)
Solid (I can thrown them into a backpack without worrying about them)

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I really think apple has missed the mark advertising the iPod touch mainly as a game machine. The apps are extraordinarily useful. I'm very glad I decided ( at the last minute ) to get the 32 gb model. I'm not using the iPod portion that much --some music and podcasts, but the add on apps have been very VERY useful. The screen is gorgeous , the keypad easy to use. If I had to quibble I'd say my biggest gripe is that flash and shockwave don't work yet. I know why apple has done that, but it's inconvenient. Youtube videos are fine. Battery life okay if you aren't on the internet the whole time -- i am, so it gets about five or six hours. Wifi reception has been excellent. Built in speaker is tinny and not loud enough, but i rarely use it so i didn't take off for that. There's an app to share files with your computer wirelessly, which is handy for transferring  stuff via webdav connection to read later when you have no connection. Another app lets you capture articles from news and web sources to revisit later. There's even an app to make voip calls from the touch. (you have to add earphones with a mic -- picked up a pair on amazon for $7 and now make occasional calls via Internet. there have been a few times that I REALLY missed not being able to connect when away from wifi, but I do not miss the 2 yr contract to at&t. if you have wireless handy and don't need a full service phone contract this is the answer."

But it doesn't like iPods: the connection will be lost (not a good idea to disconnect an iPod without ""ejecting"" it), or no connection will be made at all, or the port on the computer where the hub is connected will lock up.

Also, the build quality is poor. The silver finish is uneven, even worn off (out of the box) in a few spots. And the clear cover over the LED indicators is falling off.

Perhaps Belkin's new ""Plus"" hubs are better, but I'm not willing to find out.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"My in laws got this for our son who is one this Christmas. He absolutely loves it! I put together a pros and construction based on my opinion:

Pros:
- it has three different paths it'll take depending on which position the rail switches are. This keeps it entertaining.
- very easy to put together. The instructions are very simple to follow. It is a little time consuming because you have to screw in nails about 15 times or more throughout. It probably took me about 30 minutes.
- it is well structured. I'm not too worried about it falling apart anytime soon. My one year old is pretty rough with it and it doesn't even flinch.
- comes with two cars (one boy and one girl). You can also use different cars to that you may already have like hot wheels and the smart wheels cars. Our kids have all kinds that they use.
- Even my 5 year old enjoys it. Sometimes I have to remind her that she needs to let her little brother play with it.
- No batteries needed! We all know that's always a plus.
- let's kids use their imagination! Any toy that allows kids to do this is a plus for me.

Cons:
- It is a bit large. We live in a apartment and this takes up a lot of space. It's about 37 inches tall and 18 inches in width. If you have the space, won't be an issue.
- It doesn't have two entrance paths so the cars can't race. This didn't seem like a big deal but my 5 year old has been taking about this, so I thought I would add that in here.
- There's a lot of pieces when building so for some it may be overwhelming. Don't worry the pieces all are numbered and colored so very easy to identify when building.

Overall, I would highly recommend this toy for little children. Even adults can have fun with it."

It's a fun toy for them and they're always trying to make something together. My daughter loves it!This is a great starter set for little ones. I have a 10 year old who loves horses and this one was perfect. I was able to get it to fit his 7 year old nephew perfectly. He is 4 and has had many adventures with it."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Poor, misguided, drunken Superhero Hancock, seems to have lost his way along with his memory. Lonely and destroying more than he seems to save, not caring what anyone thinks or how they view his escapades, Hancock drinks, curses and half-heartedly saves those in danger.  Among those he saves is Ray, an advertising and marketing guy, who attempts to change Hancock's image so that the world will value him as a ""true"" hero.  With new purpose, a new attitude, and a new outfit, Hancock finds the answers to a lot of questions that he has been searching for (including who and what he is), from an unlikely and surprising source (another of his kind).

While some may not like the ending, if you really think about it, what other outcome could there be, where everyone would be happy? Those who are immortal and will live forever will eventually have the ending that we all want, it will just take patience.  The peace and calm that Hancock finds shows us his true spirit.  After all, what is waiting another few years to find complete happiness, for someone who waited 80 years to discover the truth about who he is?"

Well made thick plastic

I used it to install two bathroom fans this last weekend and it was perfect.  With the skim coat its not strong enough to stick to a wall or ceiling but the stick stands up and gives you a high-five when it crosses a nail or screw.  Yes, it can take a minute of systematic swiping to find the first one and then move up and down to verify (in the ceiling it helps to know which way the joist travel).  Super happy with this.

UPDATE :  I must say, this company certainly cares about making things right.  I bought a pair of these headphones last year and the results were bad.  SoundPEATS contacted me and offered me a new pair at no cost, the only request they had was that I consider updating my review.  I have used them for a week and the new set works great.  The sound is great for the price.  The range is nothing like the first set and I didn't have problems losing connection this time.  They come with several different ear bud options and once I figured out which ones worked for me they stay in my ear just fine.  The wire that connects them does make noise when it bounces if you are running but using the clips that come in the box completely solve the problem.  I got a solid 4 hours use out of them, could be longer but thats the longest I used them at once.  The voice prompts for volume and incoming calls are nice.

I used to love reading cozies, but then they began to feel so familiar, as if I'd read them before. Every once in a while, I'll still give a book that sounds interesting a try. It was wonderful to read this and feel that love again."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,CG,I just got my first one of these and it is a great deal for the price.  The other two have had a similar issue.  The dog is a chewer and it's difficult to get her to eat it without a bit of effort.  I'm happy with this one and it's great for her to keep it in her mouth and not chew on it like the other two.  This one has a nice nice strong metal ring on it that allows it to be easily removed.  I've used the smaller size for my little girl and she loves it!  I'm glad I found this.I have used this for a couple of years now.  It is very easy to use and does a good job of keeping my dog from biting through the harness.  I was able to return it several times.  I would highly recommend this.  We just took off our dog and have not had any problems with him.  I would recommend this for anyone who has a dog with a loose leash.My cat loves these! She has no trouble

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,This is a really good ladder.  My only criticism on the installation instructions is that they should have a picture that illustrates where the retaining bolts/nails go instead of a written description.  A picture is worth 1000 words (and they only used about 20 to try describe the nail placement).

It's slim sleek foldaway design makes it easy to take with you on the go.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"This was a really interesting film. I think what the writer was attempting here was a look into our ""shadow"" selves. It definitely was trying to show that we are many different people, and we show different ""faces"" depending on who we are dealing with throughout our lives. I found the music to be somewhat annoying. I didn't might the drums so much but the creepy sexual undertones in an Ingmar Bergman style along with the 40's esc dramatic - and I might add ""irritating"" music. The switching to creepy black, and white; as well as the image of spiders also reminded me of Ingmar Bergman's style of cinematography. The scenes in which the characters didn't ""turn the damn lights on"" kind of bugged me. Again, the Director may have intentionally done this to show that sometimes we ourselves are not even aware of these different layers within our personality's. Be sure to watch the interview at the very end of this film if you're left feeling like...""What the Wha--...did I just watch?"""

The blade is solid and strong and the handle is well made.  The knife is very sharp.  I use it for hiking and also for a handbag or a portable phone.  The handle is well made and strong.  The handle is made of a very thin material and is very stiff.  It's very easy to open and close the blade.  The handle is very secure and is easy to store.  The knife is super light and easy to carry.  The knife is very sharp.  It's a very good knife for the price.  The only negative is that I can't really see how it will hold a knife like this.  It's tough to open and close.  The handle is sharp and it's very comfortable.  It's very comfortable.  I would recommend this knife to anyone looking for a knife that will hold a knife like this.  I'll update this review if I find a better one.

One thing to note about this knife is that it is a little on the light side.  I was able to see my feet in the dark at night and it's a little annoying to get the light off of my wrists.  I'll see how it holds up, but for now I'm happy with this knife.  I also liked the way it looks and feels.  I'm giving it five stars because it's very sturdy.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"I have my chains sharpened professionally when they begin to cut crooked due to uneven wear.  Otherwise, I touch them myself as soon as they fail to cut uniform shavings.  This usually occurs after about an hour of cutting hardwoods or two hours of softwoods.  If the bar gets into the dirt or you hit a nail you will be sharpening even sooner.  You can either carry several chains to get you through the day or be prepared to touch them up on the bar.

I prefer to touch up my own chains because the saw shops usually take off about 2MM of steel when they sharpen.  At that rate, a chain does not last very long.  If you touch up your own chains when they first begin to dull, you will only take off a few thousandths of an inch.

This tool works well if you gauge the grinder off of the tooth as described in some of the other posts.  The problem is powering the grinder while in the field.  Cordless grinders don't hold a charge very long so you need to carry extra batteries.  Corded grinders need a place to be plugged in.  Either solution limits you mobility.

I prefer the ""Oregon"" brand file and gauge.  No electricity required and it easily goes in your thigh pocket or field kit.  Only one or two strokes per tooth needed for a touch-up and you are back to work.  The gauge make it easy for even a neophyte to maintain proper tooth shape and depth."
Books_5,5.0,CG,"I wasn't sure if I would like the story, but I did.

The first couple chapters were so slow that I didn't know what to expect.  After a while, I started to get tired of reading the same old story over and over and over.  The pacing was so slow that I was lost in the story.  There was a lot of tension and suspense.  I didn't care for the ending, and I didn't like the ending either.  I was left wanting more.

The second half of the book was so slow that I couldn't get into it.  I felt that the story was not worth reading.  It was just too long and boring.  I couldn't get into the story at all.  I was left wondering what was going to happen next.

I didn't like the book at all.  I wanted to know what was going to happen next.  It was like watching a movie that was not made into a movie.  I didn't like the way the characters were portrayed.  The dialogue was so immature and boring.  The writing was so lame that I just couldn't put it down."

Books_5,4.0,CG,"We were introduced to the characters of the book and they all came together for a very satisfying story.

I had to say, ""Okay, I'm not going to say it's a cliffhanger. Just because I'm on a cliffhanger doesn't mean I have to say it's a cliffhanger. I'm going to say it's a cliffhanger because I just want to get to the end of the book and I don't want to go back to it. I don't want to be around forever. I want to go back to the past.""

I found the book to be very well written and the characters well developed. I found the story of the two main characters interesting and the plot of the story to be very realistic. I found it very interesting to watch their interactions as they made their decisions and how they changed in the past.

I enjoyed the book a lot and I thought the author did a good job of setting the mood of the book and the story. I was very disappointed with the ending of the book. I was hoping for a more more ""realistic"" ending and was disappointed in the ending. I hope that the author doesn't change the ending of the book. I think that is a good thing.

These are perfect because they have a soft sole, which is the best type of shoe for a little walker. She loves wearing them. Even though they are a little big on her, they stay on because of the ankle strap. They are well made, so they will last long, too."

This is another Langdon thriller that has us enthralled with many interesting art history references.  But you must read on because it does not stop there.  It brings back the moral and ethical questions of Zero Population Growth from my formative years, a cause to which I made a life-commitment.

The larger ones are very thick but the design (on all four, actually) is visually attractive. They come individually wrapped but all packaged in one bag. The cord binding them is not stiff, so even though it only moves on one side, the loose ends hang down nicely rather than getting in the way of things."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,So I was shocked with the cliffy in part 3 and eager to see how that played out and who that was. WOW that's a twist I didn't expect. Alicia has some serious past issues and everyone is on high alert now with this new piece of info. On top of that Adam and Ace have somewhat resolved their issues and if they could just get Alicia on board it would be great. Ace and Alicia seem to be having the biggest issue BUT for a bit things get back to the sexy heat we crave and things seem to be smooth sailing. That is until Alicia does the math. Ace is now having less time to spend with them due to work and their surprise weekend ends this part with yet another cliffy.... I honestly DID NOT expect Ace to react how he did. I am a little let down with him. He seems to want the chances but never wants to give the benefit of the doubt to anyone else. We shall see if this new struggle smooths over easily or not.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This helmet is absolutely fantastic. It comes in sizes. It has good adjustments for the internal cage AND for the chin straps. You can adjust both the length of the chin strap portion AND adjust the triangle portion about the ears separately. You can put the usual foam pads inside as well for final adjustments (I do not use any at all). These helmets are amazingly light in weight in spite of the fact that they are serious helmets designed for safety more than weight alone. The hard shell is firmly attached all the way around on the foam core, which makes them safer than other helmets. They do a great job of helping to protect your ears and side of your head without looking or feeling funny, the visor works well, they protect the back of your head well. I have worn mine for over 10 hours on a very slow and hilly century ride (with some stops where I left it on) and it was comfortable at the end of the day even after that long time. If you look around you can find them on sale for less than $80 if you aren't too fussy on the color scheme. Excellent."

I'm a very large fan of the blades and this one is a perfect addition.  I really like that it has a battery compartment, which is nice, and it also has a fan that can be set to turn off automatically, just like the one I have now!  The sound is excellent, and I love that it can be turned on and off without having to turn it off manually.  I also like that the blades are reversible and that it is adjustable for the amount of air you want to use.  The only complaint I have is that I don't like the ""gift"" feature.  I wanted something that would be easier to use, but I didn't want to pay more for this one.  I really like the fact that the blades come with a separate battery compartment for the fan, and the included battery compartment is great.  I also like that the blades come with a separate charger for the fan, which means that I can use the fan without having to plug it in.  I would definitely recommend this fan!I was looking for a nice, solid bed cover.  This one is a little smaller than I expected but still solid and well made.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I am very familiar with Carson, having owned a couple binoculars with HD glass. I used
those for surveillance work and for birding. One pair broke and they replaced them without
any questions. I very much appreciate the company. As for this monocular, I shopped around and looked at several and was about to pay a lot more
for a premium monocular when I decided that I didn't need it. I gambled on this unit, hoping
that I would not need the better glass of a more expensive one. It's a bit large, but I have
large hands. It isn't the easiest to focus with, but you become fairly adept at it quickly
enough. The quality seems good and I imagine that I will have this unit around for a long time. I teach firearms indoors and I needed a monocular to help my aging eyes see the. 22 caliber bullet
holes on black targets with dark backgrounds. I can readily see holes out to 20 yards with these
and I am very happy, especially at the pricepoint. I carry them in my jacket pocket for birding
when riding my motorcycle. Hech, I even tried the ant thing and it was impressive that I could
stand above an ant pile and watch them as if I was on my knees, like when I was a kid. I recommend this monocular and I promise you that you will like Carson as a brand, especially if
you have to contact them. I just wish that they would make a nice birding spotting scope. Regards and happy viewing."

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"40 Guns to Apache Pass was a Columbia Pictures production. This review is of how Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has ignored our greatest war hero and not of the poor quality of this offering. This release is not one of Columbia Pictures/SPHE's. Our greatest war hero's memory deserves better treatment. I will purchase this DVD when Sony remasters it for DVD release. Even better, Sony should remaster Audie Murphy's remaining movies not yet released on DVD onto a series of Blu-Ray collections befitting a man of his stature. Randolph Scott deserves the same multiple Blu-Ray collections of his many westerns he starred in. C'mon Sony, start mining those golden nuggets in your vaults, polish them up (remaster) and release them in standard DVD and Blu-Ray to protect them for posterity and to give us western movie collectors something worth buying. I buy 20 western DVDs and Blu-Rays to 1 modern movie today because they knew good story telling back in the day and morals of right and wrong were reinforced with their telling. Today, we have many people wondering through life without a moral compass. But, I digress. Please give Audie and Randolph the respect they deserve and do it right! You have gold mines in your vaults if you'd only realize it and treat their fans and these stars of long ago the way they should be treated. I have written to SPHE already. I hope others will too."

It was sturdy but still easy to adjust for my non-tech-savvy relatives. The only downside (and this is not related to the product) is that I bought it as an warehouse deal which said ""minor cosmetic damage possible"" but instead it was missing a whole piece. There are supposed to be little foam stickers for the corners that help keep it gripped, but it works fine without them so I just went with it. I'm considering also purchasing the one that mounts on the wall for use in my kitchen."

Books_5,4.0,CG,"Inventor, author, and futurist, Ray Bradbury, has done an outstanding job of describing the complex universe of the human mind. The book is both entertaining and enlightening, and it is a truly readable and well-written book. Bradbury is an American with an excellent knowledge of science and math. He is also the creator of several books, and one of the best examples of this is his book, ""The End of Science: A Practical Guide to New Sciences"". Bradbury is a superb writer, and his work is well worth reading. I recommend this book to everyone. I am a big fan of Bradbury's work. This is a wonderful book about a man who is at the top of his game. He has a heart of gold and a love for his country. He is very tough, with good intentions. He is a man of courage, hard work and a determination to make his country a better place. He is a man of love and dedication. He is a man of faith and love. He is a man of war and war, and his faith and love are strong. He is a man of faith and courage, and his faith and love are strong. His wife is a great husband and father.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I've read a lot of new adult romance books lately, so I've seen how a lot of them are the same, or how they differ.  I think anyone who reads a lot will kind of fall into that trap sometimes.  We always want something similar, but... not too much, you know?  To recapture that feeling that we had while reading something else, but to get a sense of more and a feeling of excitement, too.

This book is definitely that.  Right from the start, the entire thing catches you.  I honestly didn't expect what I was reading, but I liked it.  Caught and roped in, basically, and I wanted more.

Hopelessly Broken definitely provides more, too.  There's a lot going on in this book.  The characters are interesting and realistic.  I really enjoyed reading about Aeron especially.  I don't know that I've seen any character quite like him in another book.  Jenn's struggles are oftentimes something I think a lot of us can relate to, also.  Maybe not exactly, but the ideas and concepts behind them, you know?  I don't want to give too much away, but for a book like this to be as realistic was it was, I was impressed with how Tawny Taylor went about it.

One warning is that there's apparently another one planned for the future, so you're definitely going to want to keep an eye out for that.  Hopelessly Broken is on the longer side, though, so it's definitely really satisfying on its own.  I can't wait to read the second part!"

But these white ones are much shorter probably 1/4 - 1/2"" shorter in the toes. So my toes are a little cramped. The bad thing about it was that I had already worn them out and about in town before I realized that they were so much smaller so I didn't really feel comfortable sending them back after wearing them for 4 or 5 hours. I  sure wish that I could have swapped them for a 9 wide but it is too late now because I have tried to tough it out and wear them anyway this week. But I will know next time to make sure that the shoe fits very well when I first put them on. I had a stroke 13 years ago and these are the only style shoe that I can wear now. Since they slide on and off so easily they are a great shoe for me to wear! I absolutely love these shoes!!!!"

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"""Laurel Canyon"" is an entrancing languid film about the intersection of individuals and lifestyles.
Briefly, the film covers the relationship between a young professional couple who have been studying at Harvard played by (Sam) Christian Bale and (Alex) Kate Beckinsale and the lifestyle of Sam's record producer mother Jane (Frances Mc Dormand) and her younger boyfriend Ian (Allesandro Nivola).  The Harvard culture is conservative and polite whereas Jane's Los Angeles culture is uninhibited and hedonistic.  Sam is embarrassed by his mother while Alex is slowly drawn in like a moth to a flame.
The couple comes to within a hair's breadth of falling apart but it is Sam who first recognises problems and temptations when he resists an attractive work colleague Sara played by Natasha Mc Elhone.  He then confronts his partner who steps back from the edge of a moral abyss.  Sense is ultimately seen by all and the two lifestyles choose to recognise and respect their differences.
The plot is virtually non-existent.  Rather, the film is a study of the simmering tensions between two very different ways of life.  It is this tension that sustains the film."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"The day after I ordered this my husband came home with a DC40 Animal which he got at a warehouse store for way less.  Since it was a gift and included an upholstery brush I kept it and returned the one I ordered which, as an aside, was super easy.

I love the Dyson.  While it's kind of heavy and the ball thing is awkward the cleaning power is phenomenal. Don't have carpeting but the area rugs look almost new.
Am kind of partial to bagless vacs...gives me an instant return on my efforts by seeing what I've actually picked up and this canister is easy to empty.

The cord is plenty long as is the hose, great for my high ceilinged rooms.

The time to assemble the machine was approx 10 minutes, so easy I wondered if I had done it right.  Have read complaints about the instruction manual but I found it as adequate as I needed it to be.

Another thing which convinced me that the Dyson cleans better than any machine I've owned is that after a weekly vac I can use my Roomba and the little robot doesn't constantly bog down and need cleaning.  It can complete an entire cleaning cycle without begging for help.  In a household with 2 dogs and a cat that is something.

Yeah, I love my Dyson and so does the iRobot. We're both happy now."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"The storyline alternates between primarily two perspectives (a blind French girl and a German orphan boy) and timeframes until everything all comes together as France is being liberated from Germany at the end of WWII.

The prose is beautiful, and really places you the moment. It was particularly interesting to read from Marie-Laure's perspective, since, being blind, the way she would describe scenes was a very unique take. I also really enjoyed the way it portrayed WWII. This was not good vs evil, it was just two people who happened to be on two different sides of the war and were doing everything they could to survive. You feel connected with each character, which is hard to do when you know they are ultimately meant to be enemies. It's a really endearing and touching historical fiction account of WWII.

My only criticism would be the ending. Since the chapters are very short and the timeline constantly moving around, you get the sense that it's building to a huge climax. Personally, I found that climax to be a bit anti-climactic. But overall, that detracted very little from my enjoyment of the novel and would recommend to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, WWII, or well-written literature."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I have enjoyed using this coffeemaker on a daily basis.  I have not had the error problem that some reviewers have mentioned but I use a travel mug to fill the container for the single brew side which keeps it from overfilling. ,  I can't speak to the durability as yet since  have only had it for about 3 weeks but it works very well so far.
Update 9/21/14:  Have now had this for about 10 months.  It still works very well; am using on a daily basis and have not even had to do any deep cleaning(vinegar rinse etc).  Have been very satisfied with brew results from the k cups and from the carafe.  Not as satisfied with the single cup loose grounds brew though; don't use that option very often so haven't mastered the right portion of water for the strength I want.
The only errors I have had is when I wanted to brew a single cup but left the selector on the carafe setting.  That's ok thought as long as the carafe is always left in place because the single cup will just come out into the carafe. If you do not leave the carafe in place all the time though you would have a cup of coffee pouring onto the counter. If you do the opposite though and leave the selector on the single cup setting when you want to brew a carafe, it will not cause a problem because the machine just gives an error message and doesn't let the water come through - very clever, almost foolproof design."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This book was discussed on Amazon's romance forum. There are mixed feelings about this book. Some people just cannot get past the fact that the husband was violent towards his wife. I do not condone, in any way, physical abuse of anyone. This couple has been divorced for several years and he's had time to grow up and accept that he wrecked his marriage.  She left town and her father kept him on as a valuable employee.  Her father died so she  came back to work for his demolition business. The reunification of this couple was very slow because she did not trust him at all. I am not going to give a long-winded story since this one is not a gotcha kind of book. A young couple where the husband is so damaged and so obsessed with her  that he cannot function as a grown-up. One day he blows and hits her. The story is, for the most part, them having to live together because of her father's will. How they managed to resolve the violence issue and learn to love again is what makes this book a very good book. I did give it five stars.  All of he books are intense and very well written."

Beau did not see the revenge coming but when it happened he was angry and wanted to find Lola.  He wanted to destroy her?  Lola played the final card which not only hurt Beau but herself as well.  While Lola has disappeared, Beau is intent on finding her.  He goes through all the motions of being angry, looking for revenge and ultimately looking at himself and realising the part he played in this game.  How shallow of a man he became because of his money.  He realises that he loves her and not because she turned him down but because she is his equal and she owns his soul.  Lola has hidden under the radar while doing a road trip.  The trip opened her eyes up to discover what her future may hold.  After looking back on everything that they had endured, she knows she still wants him.  With her unexpected news and the realisation that LA is home, she heads home.  Can Beau convince Lola that he wants her without the games?  Can Lola ever forgive him?  I must admit I was a bit disappointed in this book.  The story lacked a building climax and was lacking conflict. Nothing much happened and most of what did made reference to things that we had read in the previous books.  In my opinion, I felt like the author was struggling to conclude this book.  The ending was really a bit of blas and the dialogue was awkward.  The head hopping between the characters was confusing.  I was hoping for more of a dramatic ending.  Overall the series was good but I did feel a bit let down by the ending..

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I was looking to add variety to my breakfast with egg, ham and English muffin sandwiches. I went for the silicon rings as I'd tried a metal egg ring my daughter loaned me and wasn't happy with it, size or clean up. These rings work GREAT! The are perfectly sized to make sandwiches using either English muffins or regular slices of bread. Cleanup is fast and easy unless you let them sit for a few hours (won't do that again) in which case it still takes minimal effort. Packaging was fine although when I first opened the box and packaging I noticed the rings didn't lay flat. However, the instructions say to let them sit 30 seconds on the hot pan which lets them flatten out. Had no issues with seepage. I also wasn't impressed with the suggestion to add some water and cover them while cooking, but I tried it and now do it every time. My only negative is the ""Free Bonus"" eBook which is essentially a poorly thrown together slide show with unimpressive links. As I didn't buy the rings for the free book, that didn't impact my rating. BTW, my daughter asked for the link so she could order a set."

However, the prongs that hold the stall doors in place break VERY easily - 2 of 6 are down for the count within the first month. One broke through play - granted, he is a 3 year old boy and is not exactly ""gentle"" with his toys - but the other broke during assembly.  It was easy to put this barn together so there was minimal force applied.  I contacted Breyer for some replacement doors, but was informed that they do not have a parts department.  My son probably hasn't even noticed that the doors are missing so I didn't press the issue, but it's till annoying.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"The 2 gig version of this HD 6450 was only $10 more than the 1 gig version. A deal! I do not game, so I have no need for a super OC card. I do use CPU hogging music software and I just want a graphics card that can stay of the busses as much as possible and run without any CPU support. Also, a fan is a big no-no.

There was some driver problems with the Fuel. Service.exe file, which seems to be used only when the card is in Turbo-mode. I turned off the Turbo and stopped the Fuel file from running with MSConfig and that seemed to work. I just installed newly available Catalyst driver/software. Will see what happens next... I haven't had to turn off the Fuel ... yet.

AMD's software is very well conceived and easy to use, with one exception: I am using the HDMI port at times for viewing HULU on my LCD-TV as well as dual displays. There was adequate info on how to set up a dual display system, but absolutely nothing on how to use the HDMI port. Clue: Detect the HDMI first, then set up a preset. After you get all this figured out, you will see the beauty of having many presets to suit any need. The software is quite versatile. Just run the software, select a preset, and voila! New and varied display/graphics setups with different characteristics and functions to suit your software needs.

My last card was an NVIDIA based PNY. It was defective, registered, under warranty, and PNY did not want to give me a new card without my sending them the defective one first, meaning BIG downtime for me (shame on them... I'll never buy another PNY product again). I bought this XFX 6450 instead and I am glad I did. It is without question a much better card. Well worth the $$ !! Buy one!!"

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I love sandals, especially since I live in the Phoenix area where it is sandal weather nearly year-round.  I have many, many brands of sandals from cheapie flip-flops to expensive dressy low-heel sandals, to go with all manner of clothing, casual to classy. However, I think I have found my perfect sandal with these!  Comfort, style and support - all-in-one.  I have a casual colored pair now, but can easily state that other colors will meet the nearly classy mode for slack outfits.  I have a high in-step and these sandals support every millimeter of my soles. The adjustable straps would allow for wider feet, although with my narrow feet, I could easily want a bit more tighter fit; however, foot movement is minimal due to  tri-band construction of these beautiful sandals. My new goal is to begin the process of getting these sandals in all the colors that fit my clothing/color style...which may be all of them!!!!

PROs:
Little to no break-in time required!!! Honest!
Great fit with adjustable straps...all three straps!
Excellent supporting foot-bed.
Quality materials.  Love the leather smell!
Flexibility. Sandal can flex in perfect harmony with natural body movement.
Sole - perfect on all surfaces!
Decorative medallions and bead - adds a touch of fun!
Fit - true to size...I wear a 6.5 - 7.0 and a 7 was just slightly bigger as I would expect in a quality shoe that comes only in whole sizes.
Love the mixed colored selections and the metallic leather choices!

CONs:
None....I tried very hard to find a negative in these sandals but could not come up with one.  Oh, perhaps I wish there were even more colors!  Patent black leather, cream, silver, light blue..."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I do love it.  It's light weight, feels well built, rolls easily over cracks and great for getting the boys out of the house and into some fresh air.  I know it's silly to take two cats for a walk in a stroller but have you ever walked a feline on a leash?

I received this last week and the first 3 times they balked a bit as I made the walk only 20 minutes long.  Gradually they got used to being in a confined area.  I kept it open and in the living areas so they could play in it but their play got to be a bit rough and I see they have a pull in the netting.  That was my fault and certainly not of the manufacturer.

Now I bring it out of the closet and they both get in.  The walk is up to 1/2 hour and today they even laid down and I didn't hear a peep.

You should question how big your critter is before putting him into this stroller since it is a tad small.  My cats aren't yet a year old and probably not even 5 lbs. each.  There's no problem with them walking inside.  However, I hope they don't get too big to use through the years.

I recommend and do like the no zip.  The only thing I don't like is that I can't store the stroller folded and standing upright.  Perhaps I'll need to get a luggage strap to wrap around."

NOAH'S COMPASS features Liam Pennywell.  In the opening pages, we learn that he has lost his job as a teacher and that he is moving from his apartment into a smaller one to economize.  We discover a few other bits and pieces as well:  he has been married twice (he is divorced from his second wife), and he has three grown daughters plus an older sister.  And then, after an exhausting day of moving and having settled gratefully into bed, Liam wakes up the next day in a hospital, with no memory of how he got there.

This is certainly an interesting premise for a novel.  Liam has not forgotten who HE is; rather, he simply has selective amnesia for the events surrounding the break-in to his home (for he is told that is what happened) and everything immediately thereafter.  Initially, he becomes obsessed with getting these memories back, which leads him on sort of a quest, bringing a new woman unexpectedly into his life, Eunice.  But from here, the book becomes much more haphazard, taking many seemingly random twists and turns--e.g., we learn more about Liam's past, there is some development in the relationship with his daughters, etc.

Ultimately, however, there seems to be no true purpose to this story.  Although I found Liam likable and was actually rooting for him, there just wasn't much to root for by the end of the novel.  So, while the reading of this book was mostly enjoyable, the lack of a satisfying conclusion was disappointing, and with that, I give it a final rating of 3 1/2 stars."

I'm not going to spoil it for you, but I will say that it is a well written book. You will not be disappointed. I have read all of the James Patterson novels and this is the first I have read. I couldn't put it down and I can't wait to see what happens next. This book is the best of the series. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Patterson novels. A perfect addition to any library.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"The continuation of the compelling wild wild west in 2087:  The Doctor is a player, a wolf shifter and has a rowdy family of brothers and cousins. While helping his brother claim the woman he has loved for years, Parker meets and literally falls for her friend, Lynn.  When the bad guys come to town looking for his soon to be sister in law, a fight ensues with a lot of needed healing for the doc.

Lynn is injured and taken to Parker's hospital/office.  When she wakes she immediately starts working with the doc to save lives and treat outlaws and good guys alike.  While amazed at her ability, and his protective, possessive attitude they work side by side.  She expects him to belittle her ability.  She's not prepared for his desires and her response.

There is a hilarious scene with Parker's Mom and Dad where some of Lynn's secrets are revealed.  Alpha male attitude towards his mama will make you laugh out loud.

This one has it all, strong, sexy shifter, who can put his foot in his mouth in a flash, romance, hot sex and a great ending.

I can't really explain how exited & pleased I was at received an email from the Author saying she changed her mind about Suicide "", the original title and making it into a three part trilogy. Let's just leave it at there may have been some singing, The Happy, Happy, Joy
Joy song & the happy dance might've made a brief appearance.
This third of the new trilogy is excellent!! :)  The author took a mediocre, at best, short story & turns it into an incredible novel!!  She superbly snakes around the existing material and proficiently pours powerful scenes into the narrative that grab your attention and not let it go.  Also, I really like that she is keeping this trilogy in the same universe of "" The Blood & Bones Trabsolutely cake &It means we already have a basic working knowledge of the paranormal place & persons. There's no time wasted in big chunks of world &/or character  building.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I needed a updated router for more devices and stronger signal.  After a lot of research, I settled on the D-Link AC3200.  The router was very quick and easy to install.

So far I have two issues with the router:
1) During setup, I was given the option of changing the router name and password, but the changes would not process.  The install wizard just sat there no moving forward in the process.  I tried again with the same result.  I finally kept the factory given name and password (which in reality is more secure than the password I would have chosen).  The wizard continued and shortly completed install.
2) Our devices randomly drops connection to the router, but will automatically connect about 1-2 seconds later.  So far, this has not caused any issues with streaming video/music/movies.  I need to research this more.  This may be caused by the router switching devices to a different band to spread the bandwidth demand evenly.

The router is considerably bigger than our old one.  This will require more space than you may expect.  This router is 15-21 inches wide depending on how you arrange the 6 antennas.  The suggested arrangement is to set the antennas at a 45 degree angle.  The router is 21 inches wide with this setup."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I adore this product!  I appreciate when it's evident that designers gave thought to things like how to make a product take up less space when stored and how to maximize convenience when used.  The color is great and the silicon has a nice feel that provides a good grip.  When collapsed, this lunch box is very compact, making it easy to store.  Also love that it's dishwasher safe.  The best part though is just its overall functionality.  I love the addition of the fork/spoon utensil and that it clips down securely into the top.  The compartments are generously sized.  The top has latches on all four sides, ensuring there won't be any leaks.  (Keep in mind that there isn't a complete barrier between the compartments internally though, so it is possible for the compartments to leak a bit into each other, depending on the contents and the direction the lunch box is carried in.)

My son is involved in a great many events each summer through our local parks & recs program and often needs to bring a lunch along.  The portability of this versatile product will serve us well in this regard!  Even if he flips his canoe, his lunch should stay dry and tasty!

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,CG,This hammock is the size that will fit the long legs of a Giro bike. It has a nice two-person fold-down design and is light and easy to take on and off. It is also very comfortable to sit on. The construction is very sturdy and the fabric is also very strong. The hammock is made of a very durable material and is very strong. I will say that I will probably not buy this hammock again. I have a hard time finding hammocks that have a strong construction. I would definitely recommend this hammock for anyone who needs a hammock that will last a long time. I used this for a couple of months and it did not break. I did have some problems with the belt being pulled tight around the waist. I also had a few issues with the belt not fitting properly. I have no idea how to fix this. I will update this post if I find a way to fix it. My only other complaint is that the handle is a little loose. If you have a large handle and it's loose you will feel a little pressure on your hands. If you have a large handle and it's loose it will be harder to grip the handle.
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Another great BDB book.  What I love about JR Ward is the fact that she introduces these main characters in earlier books so when the book finally comes up for them, they are already pretty developed and then you pop right into the story.  the way she twists it around and brings in stories on existing Brothers is also great.  Some series books will have the main characters and then you never see them again.  Not so with this series.  I keep thinking where is she going to go with this now, and she keeps surprising us.  Great read but you need to have read the priors to understand what is going on."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Not the best shoe storage container I've had, but it works. The fabric is a bit thin, and I feel that my heels will eventually poke through it. There isn't much support and mind definitely doesn't stand up stiff like the one shown in the picture. This would be perfect for child shoes, or for flats. Tennis shoes and heels do not fit together in one slot. They take up two because of how small the slots are. That being said, I put my expensive shoes in this container so that they don't get ruined or dirty by other things in my closet or by other shoes touching them. I keep it in my closet as it doesn't fit under the style bed frame I have, and it works wonderfully to keep them clean and organized.

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"I bought this DVD for 5 bucks, and I still overpaid.  I wanted to like this movie!  It's a great premise.  It has Sam Jackson in it!  How bad can it be?  Well, the antidote to any potentially great movie is Bruce Willis.  He's no Kevin Costner now, I'll grant you that.  But he's very near the bottom in terms of acting ability.  In this flick, we're not really sure if he's mentally challenged or an adult or what. It's hard to tell since Willis seems that way in real life.  Not the sharpest tool, if you will.  His lack of acting chops ruins an otherwise great movie.  Hopefully, someone will do it again with a real lead actor who knows how to ... act."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I usually don't carry my Mosquito at all, but for those rare times that I do I wanted a comfortable, workable holster. Even though I didn't have any prior experiences with any of their products, Fobus has a reputation for good quality gear so I bit. Generally it does the job well, but this holster is still a tight fit after a couple of weeks of trying to break it in (snapping the gun into place and then removing it repeatedly). This works better at gun removal when the holster is worn on my person because of how tightly it holds onto the Mosquito, although initially the draw motion was almost more effective at removing the gun AND holster off my body rather than just the gun itself.

A few scuffs have shown up on the forward edge of the gun's trigger guard as a result of the tight fit, but it's not something I usually fret over for something as basic as a .22LR pistol. On the person, it fits well and is comfortable enough, but as with any gun of length there are certain positions with me that don't work as well, like sitting. Drawing the gun is still something of a challenge (requires a very firm, well-intentioned pull) because the holster seem like it does try its best to keep the Mosquito held in place; good if someone's trying for your gun but not so hot if you need access in a hurry, or just want to take it for any other reason. But overall it's still a good value holster for an excellent (at discount) price."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"When I was a little girl, I had a wolf ring that I adored bought in some tourist trap Estes Park, Colorado, Keystone, South Dakota, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, someplace like that which I honestly don't remember, but I loved that ring, even though it was a man's ring that only fit on my thumb.  Alas rings that a child can afford are not the best quality and the silver plating quickly wore off my thumb turned green and I could no longer wear it.  When I saw this ring from Moon Wings, a company I have had nothing but stellar experiences with, I knew that I had to have it, but upon reading the other reviews I realized that this ring is very big and clearly a man's ring I changed my size from a seven to a nine and decided it would work for either myself or my boyfriend. It is lovely. There are two things I think the future buyer should be aware of the wolf is not the cuddly sort, he looks to my eye angry and ready to kill, if you are a wolf lover who wants a gentle noble spirit animal, be aware.  Also if you wear this ring as a statement to the viewer of your hands rather than yourself, in other words facing outwards, the little stainless teeth have a real tendency to catch on things and if you wear it the other way to the observer it kind of looks like nothing much just a canine of some description.

UPDATE: After using these for a few nights, I discovered that two of them had moved on the hard hat. I don't know if it was the freezing temps outside, or the hot temps sitting on the dash in the truck. Whatever the reason, I had to replace the tape on one of them. The tape they use it not the same VHB tape that I have. And I have 3M VHB, right out of the box, that I have used for years, so I know mine is legit.) These are not good for hard hat use. Two Cons...The holders are flat. There really is no flat spot on a hard hat, so there will be a small space along the edge that will not adhere to the surface. Its why Go Pro makes curved helmet mounts. Its a big deal, because enough of the VHB tape does make contact. Also, the holders are two different sizes. There is no instruction as to which goes where.

It is so bright and bright I am able to see the light from the side and it is easy to adjust to fit in the trunk of my car. This light is excellent. The light is bright enough to see my bike and it also has a low profile on the front so you don't have to worry about it falling off. The light is bright enough to see when I am riding in the dark and it is easy to see when I am out in the dark. I am 6' and 185 lbs and the light is great for someone with a large head. It is a good size and I like that it does not have any rubber pads or striping. It is also light enough to be worn under your clothing. It does not have any screws to hold the light down or anything like that. It does not have the polarized reflector. It is a good deal for a single source light and it is good enough for someone who is always looking for a bright light to use when riding on the road. It does not come with any locking or locking mechanisms and I can't see anything from the outside.

I have a large head and this light is perfect for me. I am 5'11"" and my head is a little long so I am not too big. I am 6'5"" and it fits perfectly.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"This is based on the Iain Sinclair credit card knife. These ones however are generic and have no brands imprinted on them. I do not have an authentic Iain Sinclair knife to compare these with, so I'll go stag with this review and give you the raw details and ONLY this product.

I ordered these on Amazon from China in a bulk package of 4 for about $5 as favors for friends. Now in its packaging, already I notice the plastic parts wobble... because they are extremely thing. The cards measures 5 3/4 inch by a little more than 2 inches. They're easy to figure out how the use despite the fact that they do not come with instructions. There is a safety wheel that needs to be turned with a fingernail so that the blade can pop out. After you fold the blade back along the cutout, the other two flaps of the card fold together to form the handle. They will not pop out unless you force them apart.

The knife itself is about half a millimeter (mm) thick. This would not be applicable for any defense situation, This would however come handy with opening letters and tapes  (but not bubble wrapped packages or cardboard boxing). The entire knife is not as a solid as an actual switchblade or letter opener and flops around quite flimsily.

The folded card will fit in most wallets where credit/gift/debit/reward cards usually go. The card is lightweight and will take no more than 6-7 seconds for an average person to assemble.

Great novelty item, but not very applicable. I may buy the original Iain Sinclair model to compare, but if there are for your collection or as favors to friends, you might as well go for it, for the great price these are offered."

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"There are many hoof supplements and they tend to have very similar ingredients, but do vary.  This means that depending on exactly why your horse doesnt have top quality hooves, different supplements may work better for your particular horse.  Or, of course, if your horses hooves are of poor quality for a reason not related to nutrition, supplements may do nothing at all.

B vitamins, particularly biotin folic acid and Bs are important for the hoof.  According to the guaranteed analysis, this supplement only has biotin.  It does offer a high level of this, at 25 mg per serving.

Zinc and copper are the mineral supplements most likely to help hooves and this supplement offers them both.

A deficiency of particular amino acids can cause problems with the hooves.  The white line can deteriorate if there is a deficiency of methionine.  This supplement is high in protein and does offer methionine.  However, several other hoof supplements offer more methionine, so if your horse has issues with his white line, take a look at Hooflex Hoof Builder or Farriers Formula Double Strength.

Hooves need both omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids and this offers both, though twice as much 6 and 3, so this isn't the greatest supplement for omega-3 fatty acids, though you can buy those as a separate supplement.

Nearly all of the nutrients important to hoof health are also important to coat quality, so if your horse is lacking in both it is quite likely that a hoof supplement such as Horseshoers Secret Extra Strength will help.  If this one doesnt do the job, look for another that offers different hoof-related nutrition  perhaps one with more omega-3 fatty acides, more B vitamins, or a different mix of amino acids.

There is no one best hoof supplement, because what the horse is eating for the rest of his nutrition is such a big factor.  However, for most horses showing less than idea hoof quality, this is a reasonable starting point to see how they respond."

Books_5,2.0,OR,"I obtained an advance reader's copy of this book some time ago and had several false starts trying to read it.
My first attempt was on an Orlando to LAX flight - I literally had nothing else to do but open the book and read.
Somehow, I just couldn't get into it.  Some books draw you in and hold on to you even after you're finished.  This is certainly not one of those types of books.

My second attempt was in a car dealer's waiting room.  I opted to wait for my car.  Due to an unexpected delay finding a specific part, my estimates one hour wait turned into a 3 hour wait.  Again, I resumed reading this book yet couldn't manage to make myself turn the pages.  I read a couple more chapters but still couldn't muster enough interest to continue.

Then I find myself on another coast to coast flight, this time in a comfy seat up front.  Near the endpoint of the flight, my seat-neighbor asks me how the book is...I told him that I have tried to read it several times but I can't seem to garner enough interest.  I mentioned that I fell asleep twice trying to force myself to read the pages.  I also told him of my plan to review it on Amazon and that it would not be fair to review the work until I have properly read it.

All of that said, I finally did sit down and read the book.  Yes, the first third seems to plod along.  The book does pick up some, probably because I developed a form of literary Stockholm syndrome being a slave to its pages.

Overall - the novel's plot development is slow.  The characters, and there were too many of them, were not especially memorable for me.  The whole thing was predictable.  I would not recommend this book."

Basically, the story recounts how a paranoid bi-polar man helped write and research a huge portion of the world largest dictionary. The professor is the then editor who befriends the man, not knowing his new-found contributor resides in an insane asylum.
Along the way we get fascinating peeks into the creation of the OED, Victorian and Edwardian views on mental health and quite a few other asides.
I am not sure that this is a book so much as a long magazine article (think New Yorker style). Occasionally it seems that Winchester overuses foreshadowing and previewing to ""fluff"" the work up into book length. At one point he mentions that the event he was going to talk about was the most important even in the 20th century. What he does talk about next is very interesting, but he offers no clue as to how, even in the context of the story, the event was ""the most important event."" Hyperbole like that is strewn throughout the book and does not need to be. This story is fascinating on its own.
A good light read. It is probably an excellent introductory text for College students as it is more of a springboard to other topics than a complete in-depth exploration of anything on its own."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My doc has been after me to use Hibiclens for a chronic skin problem I've been suffering with.. Problem was I couldn't afford it.  So being a rather resourceful person, I figured it out.  If a Vet. grade product that is used on animals is safe, and it is the same basic chemical as Hibiclens (without all the dyes and perfumes) then what the heck do I have to worry about?  So I tried it, and it worked. But the real test came when I went back to my doc and told her that although I could not afford Hibiclens, I got a Vet. Grade product of chlorhexidine and used it.  Her response? She smiled and gave me a thumbs up!  In other words folks, if this stuff is safe for Fluffy it's safe for you too.  That is, as safe as any chemical might be.  Use your head, read, dilute the stuff (one ounce per gallon). Don't get it in your ears and eyes and please first mention it to your doc that you intend on doing this.

Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"I got this for my Golden Retriever pup when she got spayed.  It fit the neck almost perfectly (she's at about 12 inches, so I got the medium).  It's very soft and pretty comfy.  It didn't bother her at all.

The problem is that as a larger breed, she was simply too long.  She could easily curl her body enough that she could get to the stitches around the donut without much of a problem at all.  So it was pretty useless for it's intended purpose.  But that's partly my fault for getting the wrong size.  It would have helped if they listed the outer diameter of the donut as well.  For reference, the medium is about 10-11 inches wide on the pup.  The donut itself is about 3.75 inches fully inflated.

So if you have a larger breed, absolutely go a size (or more) higher."

I also like the fact that the heel is adjustable so that it can be adjusted in the heel.  I wish I had gotten the size I normally wear and a bit smaller because I think it will make the shoe more comfortable.  I also love the fact that the straps are not glued to the shoe.  I like that the strap is not too tight to your feet.  The color is a"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"My son is all about racecars, and loves this toybox. It's pretty deep so if they throw a lot of toys in, it can be difficult to dig down to the bottom, but the red part on top is only attached with velcro, so my 4-year-old is able to remove it if he needs to. My only complaint is that the yellow slide up lid comes off CONSTANTLY. I can put it back so it's not that big of a deal, but just something to be aware of. You can design it however you like, the stickers on it come on a sheet, so he enjoyed having some input in the decorating. Would buy again. Gets the job done, his room is much neater now."

I had to replace the harness with something that would keep him from breaking his neck. I still use it, but it's a little thin and doesn't stay on for long enough to hold up well. I also have a large dog and I think this has held up well. This harness has held up pretty well. I have a 60 pound terrier mix and this is his first time using it. I will definitely continue to purchase it. Overall, it's a great harness. It fits him well and my dog seems to enjoy it. I would definitely recommend it to any dog owner."

The plot and events just didn't flow as well as they had in past books in the series.

I gave one to my dog he put it in his mouth and dropped it and went and sat on another side of the room. So I brought it to him when he was sitting down and gave it to him and he suprisingly ate it but ate it too quickly and threw half of it up. That was enough for me and I threw the rest of them in the garbage.

Too bad I have tried Rachael Ray dog food in the past and my dog loved that but this was a flop."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"If you like The Hobbit films, you owe it to yourself to get the Extended Edition.  Even though Steve Jackson did not give us as much extra material in the Hobbit films as he did in the Extended LOTR, the Extended Battle of Five Armies has substantially more material than the theatrical edition.  It also ties up some loose ends that exist in the theatrical film.  For people who like short, simple films, this entire series is too long.  For people who love Tolkien, and understand why a film cannot be the same as a book, it is too short.  Recommended."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Seems like such a small little bathroom gadget couldn't bring so much joy but you would be wrong. Nothing worse than a bar of soap all gunky in the shower. I bought this to put on one of my shelves in my new shower and it's awesome, the soap doesn't get gunky and lasts a lot longer. Love it! The only thing I worry about is possibly bumping into it and breaking it, maybe in the future design they should consider a little suction cup on the base."

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"I received a free item to review.

The sounds are loud and remind me of (if you can fathom this) a raspy-throated human infant processed through a vocoder synth. Our lab seemed a little scared of it at first (as was I!) but she quickly got the deal and loves it now.

She's a medium-large 75+ pound yellow lab yet she can't quite get her jaws far enough around the ball to carry it - if it were just an inch or so smaller in diameter it would be perfect. But she loves to nudge it around the living room and through corridors.

It's extremely hard plastic and durable - she plays with it inside and out, though the sounds carry far less outdoors (fine by me!)."

I'm not sure if it would have been better if it was just a tad smaller, but I think it would have been better.This is a great wallet for the price. It's very light weight, and the wallet is very well made.

This stuff clumps and is ultra fine making it nearly impossible to scoop because half the pan becomes like solid clay when liquid is introduced and the litter gets everywhere. We now have to change the litter about every 2-3 days. I will never recommend this garbage to anyone and will never buy it again. With how many good reviews and buys this had I was really excited but all we got was a tiny bag and complete disappointment. If you have more things to do with your life rather than changing litter every waking hour of the day this litter isn't for you. I wouldn't even spit in the general direction of this crap.

This set contains all the episodes for season one. Not a bad deal and an amazing boxset design to boot.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"If you're a fan of Inkheart and of science fiction or alternate reality, this is the perfect for you. In this alternated world in 1985 in Britain, time travel is routine, cloning is a reality (dodos have been resurrected,) and literature is taken very seriously. People can get lost in poems and stories, and first editions are forged. This is all usual for Thursday Next, a literary detective. But then someone begins kidnapping characters from stories. And when Jane Eyre is kidnapped, Thursday has to track down the villain and go into the novel herself. This is a really great book; playful and wonderful. I loved the world-building in the book, though there were a lot of specialized terms that you had to learn to make sense of the story. Also, I really liked the character of the villain, Acheron Hades. He was so deliciously evil. And seemingly invincible. Fforde's writing style was really great too; you know, that British style. It was straightforward but also had dry humor. And action, but not too much action. Fforde is actually from Wales, I think. This is the first book in the Thursday Next series, which includes Lost in a Good Book, The Well of Lost Plots, and Something Rotten. *You can read all of my reviews at my book review blog, novareviews. blogspot."

 I don't know how I feel about this book. Don't get me wrong it was good - what I read of it anyway. I had to stop reading because for some unknown reason it made me sad. I knew something bad was going to happen. The sense of foreboding was overwhelming and I just couldn't take it. I stopped reading a chapter 17 and skimmed through the rest and of course something bad happened. I wasn't so upset about the kidnapping. I was far more upset about what happened between Juliette and Killian. It was heartbreaking. I literally felt the pain of it and I wasn't even reading the whole thing. However I found myself going back to what I skipped over and reading it. The grand finale at the end wasn't so great. It should have been more elaborate. That epilogue was meh. I was expecting more. It could have been an awesome book if there was more happiness. They were happy times but it didn't feel genuine because it had a looming darkness that overshadowed it. I don't know maybe it's just me. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I hope the next book is better."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This first- person narrative account of the years that Tavis Smiley spent in the company of Dr. Maya Angelou is a real eye opener.  I did not know that he had access to her in such a personal way through a friendship that lasted over 20 years.  She took him under her wing and it helps explains his success as one of the best interviewers I have seen.  Tavis, whom I admire, lets his guests speak what is in their hearts with little interruption yet through skillful guidance.  All of those precious moments with the wise Dr. Maya surely added to his views and open-mindedness about life in general.  This is a great read and I could not put it down.  I saw her speak in Boston and I have read and cherished most of her works, but this puts an even greater spin on her illustrious life.  Thank you, Tavis Smiley.  I feel that I know her even better, now."

I was provided with a free sample for evaluation,

These are fairly priced cycling gloves that don't skimp on workmanship or comfort. I used the sizing chart and measuered my palm size as instructed. It indicated that size Large would be my size so that's what I ordered. They fit perfectly.

These are a 3-panel design and made of a microfiber suede material in combination with EVA padding and a stretch nylon. I find them to be really comfortable, particularly around the top of the glove. Some gloves I've used can be irritating around my wrist either because they go up to high on the wrist or because the material is a little stiff or abrasive. These were just great in that regard, not stiff or abrasive, not too high... just right. The velcro closure was also not too excessively long or too skinny, it was just right.

There is nice patch of microfiber on the thumb for wiping sweat off your face and small tabs on two of the fingers enable you to pull these off your hands more easily.

Not too  much padding but just the right amount for me, The padding is not gel, like many gloves, buy EVA foam. I hope that it holds up with repeated use... most of my gloves have used gel so I'm not sure what to expect from the EVA foam.

Overall I'm impressed with these. The price is fair and I feel these gloves can compete well with more expensive, better known brands."

By
Scott Turow

This is the first one of  Scott Turow's books I have read and as I understand there was a movie made from this book.

A beautiful lawyer from the prosecuting attorney's office is raped and murdered. Rusty Sabich is chief deputy prosecutor for Kindle County, and his boss Raymond Horgan is up for re-election.  Rusty is handling the investigation of the murder despite the conflict that only he is aware of with his friend, Dan Lipramzer investigating the crime. They first focus on convicted sex offenders that Carolyn helped to prosecute. Then Rusty learns that his boss Horgan had a brief relationship with Carolyn. Meanwhile Rusty's marriage is in a shambles as his wife Barbara knows about his affair. As evidence surfaces Rusty he is arrested for the killing.  But is Rusty guilty?  Or will someone else be found to have done the terrible crime.

Instead of being a predictable legal thriller, like some others I have read, this great murder mystery has plenty of twists and turns through its thick and plot.

The book was supplied to me free of charge and did not ask that I do a positive review."

This Nature's Miracle Jaw Scoop helps you keep a clean yard without too much bending over and eliminates having to get your hands any where near dog feces! I am a tall person so I wish it was a bit longer, but a short person may not even have to bend over. I like the fact that it is all plastic so you can easily spray it off and keep it clean. I have had it out in the yard with our bucket for a while and have not had issues with it rusting or anything because it is almost all plastic. I wish that they also sold a bucket or something, but a nice 5 gallon bucket with a garbage bad in it works fine. That way you can dump the load while you walk around instead of having to walk all the way to the trash. Price was like double in the pet store than it is on here so its definitely a great price!

I definitely think this novella adds to the Quarter Mile Hearts series. It begins before Quarter Mile Hearts and catches up with the story told within Quarter Mile Hearts. I totally loved that. I would recommend reading Supercharged before Quarter Mile Hearts.

Supercharged made me love Max even more and it even made me want to reread Quarter Mile Hearts because I missed this world so much. There were times I was extremely frustrated with Max because he kept trying to fit in instead of just marching to the beat of his own drum.

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"The idea, conceived by producer J. J. Abrams, is brilliant, and the story told here is exciting, riveting stuff. It's tense and, at times, genuinely scary. If not for one little problem, I would have thoroughly enjoyed this film. The problem is in the presentation. Since the entire movie is supposed to come from a single hand-held camera, everything is in Shaky-Cam (or, as Roger Ebert aptly called it, ""Queasy-Cam""). Hence, the movie quickly and continually induces vertigo in its audience; of the six members of my party, four reported some degree of motion sickness. Somewhere further down in the theater, we heard at least one person vomit. No matter how good a movie is -- and this one is, in its way, very very good -- it suffers when you can't bear to look at the screen. It's hard to appreciate the filmmaker's craft when you're trying to keep down the buffalo chicken sandwich you foolishly ate on the way to the theater. by Tom Knapp, Rambles."

There were about 5 women out of 61 people total profiled.

On the contrary Po Bronson's book focused on people from all walks of life, not those who have been VP or higher or had ""interesting"" lives.

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"Positives:
Great acting performances by Pippi and her penguins. Mostly good by everyone else except Carrey and Lansbury, at times, reverted to their stereotypic past learned phrasings and characterizations.
Enough uniquely humorous lines and skits to make the movie a mostly novel laughable experience. So, kudos to the writers for those parts.

Negatives:
Studios with their crew of writers, directors and producers know that making money takes precedence over creativity so with that thought in mind we have the following too predictable scenes:
A stereotypic plot framework of a newly divorced couple with teens.
Teens have their own issues as well as navigating/mediating the divorce.
Dad, as usual, had his own father family issues growing up.
Dad is seen as more in love with his monied vocational interests than the kids.
Mom, has a new male friend that ends up to be a boor. Yes, gets booted.
At stake is a prize piece of property that is predictably going to be procured by Dad after he re-prioritizes with the help of, guess who, penguins.
Dad also wins kids and wife after he re-prioritizes with the help of, guess who, penguins.
Penguins, at first, were presented in a clever way but towards the end the writers ran out of ideas and the animals just did the same made-up cute tricks found in most animal movies.

In summary, if the movie just had Pipi and the penguins to build around it would have had the potential to be creatively - spot on."

Then we have King and Rogue. 2 very alpha bears who shouldn't exist but obviously they do. Their clan has had all the women and adult men taken, so King and Rogue are the only 2 left to take care of all the cubs. King is stuck in tradition and believes they will help their clan survive while Rogue goes and does normal human activities when ranging and believes traditions should be in the past.

Needless to say Jill is saved by Rogue and she is marked and is now being told she is a mate. Neither of the males act excited about discovering they now have a mate. The story jumps around and there are holes where I was left thinking ""WTF happened?"""

I chose the pug because........... um, it's a pug?!? A pug face on a dog body is cute/funny enough. A pug face on a human body is hysterical.

This mask is rubber and fits a variety of head shapes and hair styles. It does have a funky smell as a lot of rubber masks do, but once it's aired out a bit, it's not even noticeable. The eye holes are actually near the snout, rather than the actual eyes, so it gives it a little more of a realistic look. The only thing I'd change is the mouth opening. If the person wearing it smiles and their teeth show it's super freaky. We're using this as a quick costume when needed, to make funny videos, to wear while riding the bike (why not - it really makes people look twice). Sometimes I wear it in the car (as a passenger, never while driving). Basically, doing anything you can think of that would look funnier if a person with a pug head was doing it.

It's a fun mask, good quality and would definitely fit a variety of sizes. See my photos for an idea of how it fits an adult woman and adult man. I'd actually like to get some of the other critters for variety."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I swim everyday as part of my exercise regime, and whenever I do not protect my eyes, they burn and become pink from the harsh chlorine in the water. I wanted a good quality pair of goggles to help me keep my eyes safe, and the Ipow Anti-fog Mirrored Silicone Swimming Goggles with UV Protection Plating Glasses + Premium Goggles Case seemed like an excellent option for me, so I decided to try it out.

These goggles seal watertight against my face, completely protecting me from water leaking through them and onto my eyes. They are cushioned, and their head strap is a comfortable silicone material. The lenses of the goggles are described by the manufacturer as anti-fogging, and so far I have not experienced any issues with fogging. They seem to live up to their claim. I feel comfortable wearing these goggles, and my eyes are wonderfully protected from burning and irritation caused by the chlorine water.

I truly do love these goggles. They are great for casual swimmers like myself, who just use them for exercise or for simple fun in the pool, but they would also be ideal for competitive swimmers. Their quality is very high, and they are so comfortable and effective. I am so happy that I ordered them. I intend to get a lot of use out of these goggles, and I believe that they will last me for a very long time.

I must disclose that this product was received at a discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review. My opinion was not altered due to the product being discounted. If I do not believe in a product, I will not give it a positive rating. Please leave a comment if you have any further questions. Thanks for taking the time to read my review!"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I love these ball design cameras! This one is impressive with a very high resolution picture, the typical menu features found on more expensive cameras, and bright IR LEDs!
The Imager is very nice, good sensitivity in low light even with out the LEDs, great noise reduction and contrast.
I have this model mounted outside in direct weather and so far haven't had any trouble from it yet. I did change out the lens from the standard 3.6mm to a 6mm for my type of Application. I would definitely recommend this model to anyone and will be buying this camera again.

Advisory: With any Camera, always double check the focus and adjust before installing for best picture. Also this model has a toggler control on the pigtail for Menu access that will need to be protected from moisture and humidity."

The first one we ordered came damaged but Amazon true to form had the damaged one picked up and a new set in our greedy little hands in under three days.  But why the one star?  Well, the set would turn on without any reason.  It wasn't a problem with other remotes or neighbors remotes, for we live in the country.  Had problems getting to customer service but when we did get them tech was nice and very helpful.  He had me do a Hard Reset.  It worked....until six hours later and it went back to turning on by itself.  I really wanted this set but in the end it was too much of a hassle.  I read many reviews and chose it for cost and star ratings.  We must have gotten one of the few lemons.  I would only recommend this set if you are buying from Amazon as they were great with return."

My only complaint is a good chunk (3/4) of pics go thru the middle seam. So that's gonna be a problem getting at. As far as I can tell pages are not perforated either. I like the book tho so I'll make it work. The pics seem pretty original. Big pics that take up the whole page.
I plan on attacking the book with markers. Most of the pics will require fine line markers. Some pics have big areas but almost every pic had areas of small details as seen in main summary. A couple of pages are empty of the small details- some are blank for you to detail your own. Ex butterflies etc. Least that's what is says up in corner of page.
It also apparently is kind of a search and find book too, tiny objects to find within the pics....with answers in the back. So its interactive. Good for all ages.
So for the price. I'm a very happy camper and can't wait to get my new markers in the mail and get going.

My 24 year old daughter saw it before me and told me you had to believe in order for it to scare you. I do believe there are spirits and hauntings, yet I couldn't get this movie to scare me one bit until the very last scene, which I won't divulge and ruin it for people. Every time the story line would move toward scary, it suddenly shifted away.

I watch shows like A Haunting and Extreme Paranormal and in my opinion, those are scarier than Paranormal Activity. I wasn't impressed and wanted my money back. My husband wanted to see it and I told him he'd be better off to wait for it to hit DVD and watch it then. If you haven't seen it, rent the movie before you buy it."

The top strap is wide but flattering and also a tinge on the shorter side.  I am wearing on the last hole so that it is not tight and uncomfortable.  I will most likely go down a notch once a little stretched to my foot.  The heel is the biggest consideration.  While I can wear them the whole day they are not totally comfortable the whole whole day.  The ball of my foot does feel some pressure as there is not a lot of padding or cushion. The heel is on the higher side of a wedge but again looks very attractive.  The material of the shoe is a suede like fabric and flexible, not stiff.  The only other issue I had was some rubbing of my baby toe which is not a defect of the shoe.  I think once warn a few more times and broken in they will be pretty good.

I prefer some other designs where you can turn it on/off back to the same mode depending on how quickly you pressed the button. One thing i may try is putting in an inline on/off switch on the exterior wiring. I've tested pulling out the batteries with it on and reinserting batteries put the light on back on in the same mode so hopefully the mod does what I need it to do.

Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

I really wanted to like this book. I thought it was a great premise and that the author was very creative in her world building. This is a book about triplets who are separated from each other at birth. On their 15th birthday their father brings them together and shares that they have a destiny together to save the world from evil.
Rise of the Trinity started out really well and had a great part in the middle, but overall it left me disappointed. There were several grammatical errors and typos. The wrong names in the wrong place, of instead of or, and similar mistakes. I found the timeline to be very confusing. When the book starts the characters are all teenagers. Midway through the book they have their 15th birthday. At times the reader is told in the narrative that years have passed, but the action would not indicate this. It might be helpful to mark the changing of time for the readers so that they are not trying to put the pieces together.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"JoJo Moyes really knows how to make me cry. Or maybe it is just Louisa Clark that makes me cry. I don't mean sobbing heartbreaking cry the way Me Before You did but I mean like just happy soul rending grief tinged cry.  I really enjoyed that the author took the time out to heal Louisa in the slow painful way of humans. Grief is hard and especially hard when you aren't left a stipend and a way to remove yourself from the things that remind you most of the departed person. I just appreciated how - human- the author made Louisa. Its not like a whole book later she was magically healed. This was sticky and messy. In many ways i doubted her just as she doubted herself. It wasn't fair of me but thats life.

Clark was remarkably human and beautiful for it. Im curious as to her next adventure however i don't know if i outright want to continue with the series.if this is series.

Everyone's favorite Dees from the first book, Glass, here has her chance to try life as a human. And she quickly lands herself in a heap of trouble, along with a romantic intrigue.

This book features the same imaginative inventiveness as the first book, and the same colorful characters. The Dees are wonderful as always. But the author's most brilliant characters, in my mind, are the Brothers Grimm. metaphysical hit men who live by their own convoluted code. This pair is calling for their own book. But let's get back to the book at hand, which is grand enough in it's own right.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this unit a couple years ago, and it is great. I use it often (mostly streaming or playing off my phone or laptop). When plugged in to the AC adapter, it is plenty loud. I use it to play songs I practice my bass to, and it's loud enough to keep up with a Hartke stack. I've never tried to play a guitar through it, but I'm sure it would be fine if you don't get carried away. When it's running on battery power, it does get significantly quieter, but still decently loud. While heavy, the carry strap does make it easy to carry around with you. All in all, I'm not sure what all the bad reviews are about. The only thing I agree with, is the radio kinda sucks. No external antenna, so if the signal is weak it will be skipped over. There is also no fine tuning to the radio. If the station isn't strong, it will be skipped over. I rarely listen to radio, so it's not a big deal for me though."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this used off of EBay, but I would recommend this computer to anyone out there. The main reason that I say that is Apples are built to last, I don't mean the case or the screen or anything like that. What I mean is Apple does not make a bunch of different configurations of computers in the same year. There are two or three models out there a year and they are all priced over $1000, why, because they last.

In the past year I have upgraded this computer in three ways.

1. Went from 4GB RAM to 8GB RAM. Want to have a fast computer, just add RAM. I have never had an issue with that.
2. Upgraded the Hard Drive to a 120GB SSD, wanna talk about speed. 9 seconds from hitting the power to surfing the internet.
3. Removed the Super Drive and added a 1TB Hard Drive for storage. I don't know of an HP, Dell, Gateway, Acer, IBM or any of the other PC companies that you can do that with. (Admittedly once I got a Mac I never look anything up about a PC again).

As for performance, I have no complaints. There is nothing that I have attempted to do that I have had an issue with this computer. It seems with a PC that within a year some of the Software out there outperforms the specs on a computer that you just bought when you go down the PC route.

Here is what I would say to you. Sure you can buy a $300 PC from WalMart or somewhere, I bet that it might be in the trash or sold within two years. I to can not afford a brand new MacBook Pro, but getting one used is less expensive and they work and hold value. Highly recommend this MacBook Pro."

I will continue to purchase more of these.This is an excellent product.  It's very easy to install and works very well.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,CG,"When I received this several days ago, the materials seemed good enough. However, the handle has a slight clang. The plastic part is also very stiff and not conducive to grip. The handle is a little smaller than I like, but it's not very difficult to grip. The texture of the handle is very soft and smooth. The grip is very smooth. I've had no problems with any of the grips I've used. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because of the small size of the handle, but I would have preferred a 5-star product.

Overall, it's a good product that does what it's supposed to do. It's not a bad product, but it does a bad job of keeping you safe. It's not a bad product at all, and it's not as good as the ones I've used. I'd still recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a good grip. I've had some issues with the plastic part of the handle, but this has worked great for me. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys griping.This is a very good knife, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a knife that is not just a good knife, but also a good quality knife.  The blade is a bit big for me, but I think that it's a good deal for the price.  It's a very nice knife, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good knife.  I would buy it again if I was to buy a couple"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"When I first tried out my skeletoes I was very happy, the cushioning was a great transition towards vibrams/near bearfoot running, and they were still light and flexible. I loved the 4 toes as they were much easier to get in and out of than 5 toe shoes. After adjusting to some seams that gave me blisters I was still happy with them. Then, even though I was 90% of the time running on concrete and asphalt, I started to get holes between the toes. I sewed them, but the holes keep coming back.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Judging by the Cover. By Dawn Doyle  4 Stars
The say blood is thicker than water, and family comes before anything. I found out real quick that blood is not thicker than Money. Everything I thought I knew had turned upside down in the blink of an eye. Demi who escapes after witnessing several family members being murdered. She is placed into protective custody  and moved across country. Demi has to keep herself hidden, not recognisable while out and about. So she dresses in goth clothes and dyes her hair. Jordan the guy that lives next door is furious that someone has moved into his best friends house. Demi and Jordan's first meeting did not go well at all. He knows he is being irrational about this but he is too hurt to care about anything but  his own feelings. Even with time they still cannot stand each other. But Jordan senses that there's something different about the goth looking girl. As their friendship develops secrets come to light and they understand each other better. They must prepare to protect themselves to survive. This was a very exciting book with lots of sitting on the edge of your seat biting your nail moments. The banter between Demi and Jordan was hilarious as much as heart warming. Can these two find love before the bad guys find Demi. The author did a great job with the story and  keeps you guessing throughout the book."

I liked the movie, but I didn't like it as much as I would have liked the book. I was excited to see this movie. The acting was great. The story was well written and the story was believable. I wish I could have seen the movie more often. I was happy to see this film released on DVD, so I can buy it again. I have seen it a few times and it was a great movie. I loved it and am glad I bought it. I would not recommend this to anyone. I am a huge fan of the horror genre and this is a great one to buy for my collection. I wish I had the movies from the first one, but I will not. I don't recommend this to anyone. This is a movie that is very cute and very funny. It's funny and very good.

I took a chance and bought this, based on the other reviews and being ""fragrance free"". I am more than happy to say, it truly is. I can't even tell we have a cat. There's zero smell. Zero. Even when it needs to be cleaned. Zero. If that's what you're looking for, get this."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,I bought this to reduce the number of remotes for my TVs.  It works very well with all of my TVs which have cable hookup.

I found it easy to program and it works fine for my purposes.
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Vanilla Sky is a visually and intellectually fascinating film that many viewers and critics found too confusing to enjoy. What starts out as a surreal mystery turns out to be an exploration into the nature of reality. In this way, it is similar to The Matrix, Dark City and some other recent films where the characters are never sure what is real and what is a dream (or computer-generated fantasy). Vanilla Sky also has some David Lynch-like features, as when people's identities seem to randomly morph. Unlike Lynch films such as Mulholland Drive, however, Cameron Crowe's story at least offers an explanation for the confusion. The explanation won't satisfy everyone (as some of the harsh criticism of the film shows), but to focus too much on this is to miss the point, which is to make us ponder some big questions regarding truth and reality. Helped by some very good performances by Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz, and some stunning visual effects (such as a truly eerie scene of a deserted New York City), Vanilla Sky is an entertaining and intellectually stimulated film. Just don't  expect a straightforward, linear story."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,CG,Works good tensioning my chain. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw that is a little too tight. The clamp that holds the chain in place is very large and it's difficult to use in the field. I wish it was a bit thicker.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"How cute (or sexy!) are these? What a fantastic idea, they took something that was needed by millions of women (chafing guard) and made it both practical and adorable. They come in a handful of colors here on Amazon as well as their website (where I ordered mine.) I got them in Black. For me, the size small was just right. MAKE SURE YOU MEASURE - don't make any assumptions on your size. How embarrassing would it be if this fell down because you got it too big.

This is very well made and has built in clear silicone rings - one at the top and one at the bottom. These are what keep it from sliding up or down. I tried really hard to a get a good photo to show the rings, but couldn't get the exact quality I was hoping for (because they're so clear.) I also took a photo of me wearing it down low on my thigh - I wasn't comfortable posting a photo in the proper place, and because it's lower than I wear it, I had to hold it in place with my hand. You get the point from the picture...

This works well to protect against chafing in dresses, skirts, short and pants. While it's not marketed as any kind of secret storage, it CAN (in my opinion) be used for this within reason. To do this, it's critical you get the right size... you COULD stick your ID, a CC and some cash inside the band (between the clear bands). It may even hold a cell phone, but I haven't tested it with anything that weight.

Overall, I really like these! Adorable (and sexy), and practical. I like mine and recommend them for others. I hope this review has helped others considering this purchase."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,CG,"This is just a plain old movie, with lots of action and lots of beautiful scenery. The story is not very good, but it is still fun to watch. I would recommend it to anyone who likes action movies. I was excited to see this movie. The acting is great. The story is the most realistic I have seen in a long time. I will watch it again. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes action movies. This is a great movie to watch with family. The characters are very funny, and the action scenes are just awesome. I am really glad I bought it. If you want to see a movie that is different from other movies, this is the movie for you."

Oh well. Four-year old doesn't mind."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"A little on the small size but as to be expected since it says that it is fitting... its also pretty thin and feels more like costume material which for some reason I didn't expect.. still cute, it'll work!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I believe I bought this set from Amazon when my son was 3, and it was the best investment I ever made!  If I had known how great these cups were, I'd have bought them at the beginning.  I've tried every brand out there, and these are by far my favorite.  They do not leak if you take the time to tighten them properly, and I give 10 stars to the spillproof parts...all others I've tried are impossible to really clean properly, and you end up having to replace those parts repeatedly if you lose track of a cup and have it get yucky.  I love these cups because all of the portions of the spillproof apparatus come completely apart so you can sterilize all the parts sufficiently before reassembling the cup.  I put the parts in a compartment of my dishwasher and use the sanitize cycle.  My son rides a school bus with me all day, and he was in the habit of slinging his cup of milk to watch the dribbles land on the walls and seats.  This made for a huge stinky mess to clean up.  He would do the same thing on long car trips in my personal vehicle when he was bored.  I'd have little white dots all over my windows and seats.  I bought these cups in the hope that they would *TRULY* be spillproof, as in he would no longer be able to ""sling"" milk from them.  Alas!  He can't do that with these cups!  I LOVE THESE!  I highly recommend them."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"This is a true ergonomic mouse. I work with computers for more than 10 hrs a day, previously I was using a logitech mouse but there was wrist pain which I started feeling. So I searched for a better one and found out this one. I should say this is a good find as I am using this one for around 4 months and no sign of that wrist pain. Also the buttons are very comfortable with an additional window button which comes very handy in day to day use. Battery wise also it is good. I always keep it on, since it has auto off battery saving feature it runs good for more than 3 months with couple of AA batteries.
I would have given it  4.5 stars but since there is no option for that I settle down to 4. The reason is that the connector build is not at all good. For me it cam apart in couple of months. So you have to be very careful while putting it in the computer and taking it out, otherwise it can become like mine (see the last picture)."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My fiancee was nice enough to buy me an aquarium for two years ago, complete with filters, cartridges, submersible heater, air pump, etc. I received an Aqueon QuietFlow Filter with my gift, and knowing nothing much about the types of filters that existed, I thought it was fantastic. Now, a little over two years later I know a lot more about fishkeeping and supplies, and I still think my Aqueon is a great HOB filter. It works on my tank alongside an AquaClear 50 gal filter, and the setup more than meets my expectations.

The filter cartridges, however, are terribly expensive. The only ""LFS"" (if you can even call it that) in my area is a PetSmart, and while I try to avoid that store, I have two cats, so I'm there more than I'd like to be. Eventually I wander to the fish section, and I surrender my wallet and its contents to the cashier. This same 12-Pack of cartridges at the store is around $42. I get the same exact thing on Amazon for a little over $20, with tax added. I rarely spend less than $35 on this crazy site, so I usually get free shipping, so that's another expense I am not accounting for.

I get six more filters online for the same price it costs me to get a 6-pack at the store. Crazy!
I think they work very well for the price, and for being just a standard filter cartridge. They're nothing fancy, but I'm satisfied with how they work. I would, and have, recommended this product to friends."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I have a 7 month old kitten, three 6 year olds and one 16 year old cat. My 6 year old Tortie figured this feeder out instantly. As soon as I put the food in one tube and moved to another tube, she was emptying the first tube. Zero challege for her but she seemed to enjoy the act of scooping the food. The other two 6 year olds figured it out after watching my Tortie. She was a better teacher than i was. However, one of them only has one eye. His depth perception is off. So for him i sprinkled kibble between the tubes for him to have to reach between and get. That still slows down his food intake but is a bit easier for him. The rest preffer the tubes. My 16 year old had to start out with no tube, but in a half hour was fine picking treats out of the smaller tube. My kitten eats kitten food as shes still growing so, shes not interested at all in the feeder as it has ""yucky big cat"" food.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I've installed two of these Panasonic fans and I'm totally sold on them.  The terrible builder quality fans are all dying in my house (six of them) so I've been retrofitting these in their place after foolishly putting in a Home Depot fan that lasted about a year.  I'm a fairly accomplished do-it-yourselfer so that said, here are a couple things to note.

1) You'll be doing some drywall cutting and patching.  I realize some folks say you don't have to patch up drywall but I can't buy that.  The flange of the fan is supposed to sit below the drywall and that requires you to put the fan in from the ceiling side of the drywall (not the attic side).  That means cutting and patching.  For me that wasn't a big deal but if you can't do any drywall patching it may be a problem.

2) The vent on these fans is 4"" in diameter and typical older houses have a 3"" vent so go ahead and buy new ducting when you purchase a fan.

3) The fan instructions tell you to use aluminum flex duct or rigid ducting but I found the plastic collapsible ducting works just fine (my ducts run less than 10' each).

4) If you use a mechanical timer on the fans (like the dial wind up Intermatic timers) the ticking of the timer may be too loud.  Yep, the fan is that quiet.  The loud ticking may bother you and force a switch to an electronic timer.

These fans are expensive.  However, compared to my old fans that sound like a blender full of rocks these Panasonic fans are almost undetectable when they run.  If I were building a house I'd insist on these fans.  They are absolutely worth the money."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Vigilante Force has a hilarious moment where a character tells another character that they can't have a Vigilante Force on their hands to deal with the corrupt cops in the town. The character turns around played by Jan Michael Vincent says, ""you already do."" It's hilarious. It's delivered with the straightest of faces that Jan Michael can deliver and it's got an endearing Keanu Reeves quality to it.

The movie's basic premise is that Jan Michael lives in a blue collar town that's completely out of control. He goes and get's a guy to come be a deputy and clean up the town. Only,, the guy turns out to be just as evil as the guys he's cleaning up. Hence, they might need a vigilante force.

Everyone in the movie is good. Kristofferson is great as always. He's a likable villain who charms his way into his position to take over the town. Jan Michael is the sort of guy you're surprised didn't play Captain America in the 70s. He looks like a piece of by-gone Americana. The actresses are randomly Bernadette Peters and Victoria Principal. Both of them are young or youngish and look like the sort of girls you could find ruling as queen bees on opposite sides of the track in a small town. The rest of the cast is great characters actors from TV and movies from back then.

It's not a genius movie. It's a trashy action movie that has some bonkers moments like a marching band member with a rocket launcher. It's also only 89 minutes. It's the best way for a movie like this to go. In and out fast. It never outstays it's welcome. It shows up with a good smile and sends you on your way."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"You can read that title either way, because it is a great big knife -- really big.  It's also a great, big knife.  I have way more  knives than I need and quite a few big knives.  I bought this one primarily because it was inexpensive and it looked pretty cool.  I have it paired (via ranger bands)  with the Condor Kephart and I took them out to the woods with me one rainy day last week looking for river birch and fat wood to replenish my depleted fire tender materials.  When I started to delimb a fallen pine to hack out some fat wood, I was really surprised and impressed by how easily this knife did the job. It does just as good at that sort of work as my Esee Junglas, for example, and costs 1/4 the price. So if you're looking for a good, big, woods knife, but want to spend less than 100 bucks (heck you can get 2 of them for less than 100 bucks), this is definitely one to consider -- assuming you are more  hunter/woodsman oriented and less tactical/survivalist oriented.

Incidentally, this particular knife came hair shaving sharp right out of the box with even grinds on both sides, although this is sometimes not the case with Condor knives.  The heavy leather sheath is what one normally expects from condor and after being well oiled, both inside and out, it has conformed nicely to the knife with good knife retention. So far I'm very impressed.  It really is a great, big knife."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a book for dreamers, lovers and the mommas boy in all of us. I lived at home until I was a vine-ripened 27, so believe me I can relate to James Thurbers Mitty. And Ive always been a fond of a good daydream. Lets see what comes to me now:

Im a powerful land baron with an eye patch. Nay, a feudal samurai lord. No, Im an oil tycoon. Fabulously rich, silver-haired, steely-eyed and whats this? Im in turbulent fight with my lover, no my sister, no my lover and her vengeful son. He has gun. So do I! This tension is terrifying. Daydream continued in the next paragraph.

Where was I? Ah yes, the daydream. Now, Im a young man. A prospector trying to hit it rich. Do I? Yes! This is my daydream, of course Ill hit it rich. Black gold. The farm is saved. I am more lost in this daydream than any I have ever had. Its spellbinding. Its tear-jerking. Spine-tingling. There are plots upon plots upon plots. It twists, it turns. Its a veritable roller coaster ride of goddamn emotion. This is by far the most powerful daydream Ive ever experienced. It feels like an eternity, yet no time has passed. I am exhausted.

And now, I have a confession to make. That was no daydream. That was me experiencing in both words and pharmaceutical hallucinations, the broad plot of my dramatic novel The Spoils of Babylon, set to air on IFC, this very January the 9th, 2014. Adapted, directed, casted and colored in full Breath-Take-o-Scope by yours truly. I do apologize for my surreptitious diatribe, but I must admit, I can scarcely contain my excitement. After more than 40 years and literally thousands of edits (two editors died), the hour is upon us. And it shall be no mere daydream.

Oh, and read The Secret Life of Walter Mitty sometime, its a delight.

Finest regards,

Eric Jonrosh, author, The Soils of Babylon, airing on IFC, January 9th, 2014"

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"One Funeral continues on right where No Weddings ends. This time it's in Hannah's point of view. It takes you through Hannah's journey of getting through the pain of what her ex had done to her in the past and re-starts the build up of her relationship with Cade.
I tend to not read stories that about ongoing relationships, but something about how this story is written makes me want to hurry up and keep reading to see how it ends. I thought the authors did a tremendous job of completely creating two entirely different characters in Hannah and Cade. Having this story in Hannah's perspective, you feel her vulnerability as she moves through the story, something you don't really get in the first book as Cade doesn't really see her vulnerable side. This entire series is much like the characters' relationship, a nice slow burn that allows the relationship to build in a lasting way.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"This is the worst purchase I have ever made from Amazon. I have had the mattress for several days, opened and laying on my bed frame. It is supposed to be a 6 inch mattress and won't inflate beyond 4 inches. I got tired of sleeping in a recliner and tried to sleep on this thing last night. After an hour of being completely uncomfortable, I put my old two inch foam topper on it and tried sleeping again. No go. This thing gives and doesn't bounce back. It's like sleeping on a board. I am sore all over after my two attempts at trying to sleep. I am contacting Amazon for a return/refund. Don't waste your time buying thing thing, even for a guest room -- your guests will hate you if you do! And, when it was opened, there was a stink in the room coming off the mattress. It off gassed for two days. I received this in Nov, 2017 and the tag on the mattress said it was made in China in Sept, 2016. So it was manufactured, then rolled up tight for over a year. No wonder it doesn't inflate. I am very, very disappointed in this. UPDATE: I returned the mattress to Amazon. There was no hastle, arranged for UPS to pick it up and the refund to my account was issued within 2 hours of being picked up. The hardest part about the return was rolling up the mattress (it was very stiff in the middle), tying it off, wrapping it up in the plastic it came in and then taping card board all around the plastic. I probably didn't have to do all of that but I did it anyway, just to be sure it arrived in one piece. Don't  waste your money on this product."

Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,"UPDATE 1/10/2016:
Despite the poor quality of these items and the doubled price, I decided to buy some more with plans to reinforce the hilt from the inside to withstand normal play.  The sabres have changed!  The buttons now have different and LESS DESIRABLE FUNCTIONALITY.  There is one switch that has an on/off position.  When in the off position, the other button does nothing.  With the on/off switch on, the other switch toggles between on and off- pretty useless!  The saber cycles through the colors and the sounds (which are, at least, still Star Wars sound effects), so that you can no longer select which color blade you want.  What self-respecting Jedi (or Sith, or Ren, for that matter) would carry a saber which has a random color with every swing?????

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

One of the sabres arrived broken out of the box with a tiny piece of the plastic at the butt end of the handle where the speaker is located broken off.  Otherwise, these were (WERE) super cool and fun out of the box.  It goes downhill from there.  Fast.

All three failed in some way after just hours of play, one failing literally within minutes.  On two of them, a flimsy plastic fin broke loose inside the battery compartment, allowing the batteries to migrate around inside the handle, rendering the lights and sounds inoperable.  I was able to repair these two somewhat easily by unscrewing the handle and gluing the fin back in place, but the fact remains that they broke after just a couple hours of moderate play.

On the third sabre, the sound stopped working, again after just hours of play.  I have not attempted to repair this one, and have not opened the handle to see if a solder would fix it since I don't have a solder gun anyway.

Spend a little more on something that might last at least a week.  No, I would not buy this again."

Maybe the author felt like the story was about Gabriel and Julia and they didn't need to be answered, or maybe it was left open on purpose for a book four, I don't know, but I would have liked to know how their story ended as well.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"For YEARS I held onto my old kodak EasyShare, it was one of the first ever produced! I loved my old one, but wanted something a bit more updated to take on my vacation abroad this summer. This camera's features are terrific: the LCD screen is large and easy to see, the functions are very user-friendly, the fact that is uses batteries is a huge plus while traveling, and it's size is small enough so that it doesn't take up too much room, but you'll never loose it in your purse and be able to have it readily on hand for those special (but sometimes fleeting) shots. The quality of the shots is not the best, but a little touch up using some photo editing software can certainly clear that up (the software that comes with the camera is convenient and easy to use, but it will not produce professional quality pictures like a bit of work with photoshop can). Overall I am very happy with my upgrade. My next camera will DEFINITELY be a kodak, but perhaps I'll wait a while and save my money to invest in one of their higher end cameras :)"

I had to order another set for her husband, because he is taller, so I had to go to the store and buy a bigger one for her. She loves it, too.

She will buy another set for her husband, too.These are super cute and the colors are great.  I love the way they are made.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because I thought they would be a bit thin for my shower.  But they are thick enough to keep my shower curtain from falling over.  And the fact that they are so small makes them great for my bath.  So far I have not had any problems with them getting wet and getting scratched.  However, I think they are a bit thinner than I thought they would be, and I will be buying more of them as a gift.

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"Daisy's friend, Chloe, invited her to her book launch party. Since Chloe's book is based on Daisy of course she goes to the party. Too bad the party was a bust. There weren't many people attending but the ones that did go sure made it a memorable night.

Chloe's publisher, Hank Hammond, argued with several employees that evening and his wife found out that he had TWO mistresses! When he was later found dead there were so many suspects it was going to take the police a long time to find the murderer. Daisy couldn't let her friend, Chloe, be declared guilty so she decided to find out who the real killer was. Detective Stern was handling the case but he wasn't happy about Daisy's interference in the investigation.

I have always liked the Daisy McDare books and the way she solves the crimes. They are well written, light mysteries that are fun to read. Unlike some other reviewers, this wasn't my favourite. I thought it was slow starting with the first 20% or so giving information about Daisy that wasn't necessary. In general, this book wasn't as interesting as the others in this series.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"This is probably the best grooming tool I have ever bought for my dog. I have a 130lb shepard mix and he sheds unbelievable.  This tool was recommended to me by a groomer and it works better for me then the Furminator and it is 1/3 of the price.  You do not have to press hard or tug, this glides smoothly and you will be amazed at the amount of hair that comes out.  My dog does not normally care for brushing but I have been able to get him to sit still longer and be *brushed* with this.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a longer hair dog that sheds alot. (plus my dog is mostly black so you see hair everywhere!)  Grooming him with this for just a few minutes a day has really cut down in the amount of hair I have to clean up all over the house from shedding."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"In a world of Elena's, Sookie's, Bella's and Buffy's it is refreshing to have a somewhat campy novel about vampires that isn't all blood and lust.

Meet Meena, the heroine of the story, who thinks that vampires are just another fad and is forced to write them into her soap opera to compete with all the other vamp shows out there.  She thinks it's a riot since people are obsessed with something that doesn't exit... or sparkle in the daylight.  Until she is saved one night by a man whom protects her during a random attack... then she begins to wonder but continues to pass it off as a one-off until she can't ignore the truth any longer... vampires are very, very real.

This story really reminds me of the early Queen Betsy books - you know the GOOD ones - and is a funny yet engaging tale that kept me entertained the entire read.  I really hope that this turns into a series as Queen Betsy should just be staked already and I'm looking for a new fun series to take its place."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I love these books by Cynthia Wright! When I first looked at this series I thought that Natayla was Alec's sister (From Caroline) it was such a wonderful surprise to find that it was his daughter. I thought that it was a great way to carry one the family line.  I was sad to know that this was the last book in this series. I love the way that Natalya knows her own mind and has no problem stating that. The interaction between the different characters is smooth and flowing. It was great to revisit characters from other stories and see how that progress. As a history teacher I find historical detail accurate and impressive. I feel that she manages to capture how people actually acted in that time accurately. The author does not shy away from writing about the hardships that people dealt with during that time, which is refreshing to see. I do hope that she continues to write about these families!"

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"Okay, I actually have one of these, was given as a gift at xmas.  It works fine, the machine is crazy simple (nothing electric, just a lever) and the CO2 cartridge is very easy to install and remove.  Because the person giving the gift bought them I have two bottles and two of the 4oz cartridges.  I personally get 11 liters from the 4oz charge (I've been keeping track to see and that's been pretty consistent).

At the moment you can at least go to Bed Bath and Beyond stores and EXCHANGE the small cartridge for $10 (buying an extra filled one off the shelf costs $20).  You just go to the cashier/service desk there and they'll have a box of refilled ones behind the counter that they'll swap with you and charge $9.99.

But they promise 16oz cartridges as an option and I have yet to find these available anywhere.  Just thinking as reading this I should contact Cuisinart and ask where I can get one.  For heavy use you probably don't want to buy one of these for yourself at least until the 16oz cartridges are reasonably available and able to be exchanged at the lower price.  I wouldn't expect to ever come out ahead on cost even with with the larger cartridge.  I mean, I can buy some bottles of plain seltzer (which is mainly what I'm making) for about 70 cents a liter.  You can get some CO2 less than that but can't get it low enough to recoup the cost of the machine I don't think.  it IS a space saver though if you're a heavy user of fizzy beverage products.  If I exchange one CO2 cartridge while the other still has some charge then I basically never run out yet only have two bottles taking space in the fridge.  Plus I'm not going through a ton of disposable bottles.  That's worth something I guess."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Bwa ha ha -- the master of the midnight movie is back, after far too long an absence from the scene, with what one might actually accept as the ultimate ""grrl power"" flick.

But acceptance is not Henenlotter's purpose here.  His aim as usual is to entertain, shock, and amuse, and he attains his goals on his accustomed shoe-string budget.

Indeed, part of the fun of this DVD is listening to the commentary, in which the outre auteur and his young white-boy-rapper producer describe the guerilla movie-making techniques they employed to realize this bizarre sexual fantasy.  The fact that they accidentally set fire to the 150-year-old mansion they rented for a whopping $4,000 as the film's primary location -- and then extinguished the flame with diet soda -- gives you some clue that this was not a normal shoot!

And then there are the purple-hued ""penis-cam"" shots...

Suffice it to say that if you enjoy ""Something Weird"" videos, you will likely enjoy this film, which also features one of the most tragic ""happy endings"" you will ever see.

As the director says on the commentary, at the consummation of this unusual love story, ""Now there's something you don't see every day.""  That's what makes this film -- and Henenlotter himself -- so special..."

I can use this mouse for my iPhone or iPad and the 16 GB version works great.  I don't have any problems with it because I do not have the iPhone or iPad in my computer.

I have to say, this is one of the best books I have ever read. I am a huge fan of her books and I would have loved to read a book with her as the main character. I have read several of her books and will continue to read them all. I can't wait to see what happens next.This book was great!  I loved it.  The story was really interesting and I liked how she got the ending.  The book is short but that doesn't detract from the story."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"First off, this is like the most adorable story I've ever read!! The illustrations, while beautifully memorizing, are vibrant and bold. I imagine that children and adults alike will adore them. The captivating artwork transports you into Lobo's world, you'll feel like you're actually there with him and his friends. This story is a very valuable way to teach children that each & every being can help and in their own way. I would recommend this to each and every child in this world because I believe Lobo is one of the most precious and beloved characters ever!!

I was pleasantly surprised as they way the seat attaches to the bowl is unique and allows for easy removal for cleaning.  I like that!

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I finished reading Everyday Zen today, and I will say that reading the book has been a very enjoyable experience.  Furthermore, I can already see some of the concepts and ideas presented in the book sinking in and making a difference in the way I approach my life.  The author makes it a point to repeat some of the most important concepts, sometimes you may noticed that what is being talked about you already read, and I think that this is critical for us to keep the important lessons in mind.

In Everyday Zen, the author makes it a point to communicate in plain English.  Sometimes this is done using little stories, sometimes by sharing some experiences, and sometimes in the form of dialogues the author has had with Zen students.  What I found most valuable is that, because of these explanations I could clearly see how the zen philosophy could directly affect my life.  Right away I was moving through my day and when fear, or anger, or plain sadness would start getting to me I would take the opportunity to think about the lessons learned by the book and apply them to the situation.  Quite useful!

I think this book has been an excellent investment for me, and I hope it is for many of you too."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"There's a lot to like about the A-Flow 5 Function Dual shower head, primarily the fact that it provides a number of different combinations and settings with solid flow (even with flow restrictors). Installation is fairly easy, directions are so so, but they include plumbers tape in the box as well as spare parts (a HUGE bonus).

It took me about 10 mins to install and get set up, once i did, I found the flow to be very solid (even with a flow restrictor on). The instructions tell you how to remove the flow restrictor, but we chose not to.

Switching between the main shower head and the extension head is pretty easy and the settings on the extension heads are as good as the main head. Of the settings, the massage mode stands out the most as it kicks out a lot of water at a high speed, pulsing quite rapidly.

The only downside of this shower head is the main connector piece that switches between the two heads is plastic and on the one I got, dripped very slightly at the switch. It's a small gripe, for an otherwise good showered.

(A-Flow provided me with a sample of their product for review)"

Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,This was nice sized but unlike other kong toys is not durable at all.  My 50 lb wirehaired pointer destroyed it in 5 minutes.  The other kong stuffed animals have been awesome.  They still destroy them but it takes a while - like 3 weeks for that to happen.  I will stay with the real tough kong toys.  I don't recommend this toy to any dog that plays somewhat rough - it will not last.  Additional squeakers are a nice thought but they also present a hazard if they can be removed from the toy.  Overall not real impressed with this kong toy.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This is a very handy set of 6 spools for hobby work.  Every work bench should have a set of these.  The spools are sturdy plastic on a wooden rod.  It's easy to pull out.  I recommend wrapping the box with 2"" packing tape to make it a little more durable and water resistant, since it's a cardboard box.  I used it for wiring low powered LED lighting for cars and lawnmowers, which need a flexible copper wire and a variety of colors.  It can handle up to 70 watts at 12 volt DC, which now includes a lot of inexpensive and unbreakable LED spot lights and work lights.  in my case, it's license plate lights and tiny work lights for dark recesses of my lawn mower."

Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"This is a GRAPE WOOD piece and only suitable for dry (desert) habitat tanks.  I bought it assuming that it was manzanita, ghostwood, Mopani,or another wood suitable for medium / higher humidity tanks but it is not.  If you are looking for something for a higher humidity setup (crested / gargoyle geckos, day geckos, frogs, etc.  then get something else.  This would only be suitable for a leopard gecko, tortoise, bearded dragon or other similar dry setup.  IMO Amazon needs to change the description to state what type of wood it is so that people would be better informed before buying it."

I would definitely buy again. Great. I like that it is so easy to store. I don't have to worry about it falling down on my counter or anything. It has a nice lid. I do like that it is not glass. I am very happy with it. I would recommend. I bought this to replace my old one that had a hole in the top. It worked fine for the first month but now the bottom cracks. It was very hard to install and the hole in the bottom was very hard to fix. It is very small and just a bit larger than I expected.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I loved this book. 1984 was the groundbreaking dystopian novel, but this was the first one to put it in a young adult context. So many of the modern YA dystopian books are clearly influenced by Lowry. It's a great, short read that I finished in one day. The plot is interesting, and the characters are well developed. If you are a fan of dystopian books, you must read this one."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"The bad:  it is a pain to turn on and off with heavy gloves on.  The app is worthless and is incredibly difficult to get the app to recognize the unit even after it is connected in the bluetooth menu.

The good:  the light defaults to the efficiency mode where the light output changes to the darkness around you.  I use the headlamp mainly for walking around outside a warehouse environment at night.  This is the mode i use 95% of the time so this tool does what i need it to do.  Easy to charge and the light on the side changes color as the battery starts to lose power.

The competition:  i also have a couple streamlight headlamps that take cr123 batteries.  They are variable with a lnob and are very handy for around the farm working on equipment and the like.  They are too bulky to fit in my jacket pocket for work (plus require spare batteries) so they don't really compete well for most applications."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,CG,"I've been a fan of this brand and the materials are good.  The only reason I'm giving it 5 stars is because I am a 32D, and the material is very stretchy.  I wear a size 7 in shoes, and the size 7 is still too tight for me.  I'll have to order another size up.  I'm only a size 10 in shoes, and I will probably have to order another size up.  I will buy another pair if they are available in another color.  I have a wide foot, and it fits great!  I'm glad I found these.I love these shoes, but the top part of the shoe is a little too high and the bottom part of the shoe is too low.  I like the top part of the shoe better than the bottom part.  I would have given a 5 star if I could have gotten them in a size 10 or 10 in the stores.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I was shipped the UK version (live in US and ordered i US).  When I tried to redeem the Ultraviolet code, I was given an error message that the code will not work in the US.  How dissappointing as I only bought this movie for two reasons: 1) to stream while away from home and 2) To watch in 3D at home.  Now I am concerned that this UK version will not play on my US 3D Bluray player.  Beware buying this version.

UPDATE - a user posted in the comments of this review a method to redeem UK Ultraviolet codes on a US account.  It worked, so I now have my digital copy also.  I also tried the disc on my 3D Blu-ray player and it does work.  I have what I wanted so I am now satisfied."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I gave this Peet dryer 5 stars because it performs in exactly the way I expected it to when I purchased it.  We have basketball shoes that need to be dried each night after practice and tennis shoes that have been out in the snow and gotten soaked.  The Peet Dryer has a button so I can choose heat or no heat.  It also has a dial that allows me to choose how long it will run.  The timer goes up to 240 minutes.
The first time I used the dryer, I couldn't really tell if it was working.  I could hardly feel any air moving out of the shoe extenders.  I was wondering if it would work... it did.  It's easy to use and fairly quiet, so I can keep it plugged in and doing it's drying job in the entry way of our home and not be aware that it's running.  The unit is pretty lightweight, but not cheaply made.  The vertical extenders that I put the shoes on are thick plastic and removable.  The center fan/digital unit is attached to the base.  I can move it from place to place easily.
I use this item everyday.  It works well to dry the inside of wet or sweaty shoes.  I would recommend the dryer to anyone who wanted to preserve and protect their shoe investment.
I have no ""cons"" to share.  It's a simple concept that works well for athletic shoes and it's priced reasonably."

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"First off, Who names these movies ? My gosh...
Very funny vignettes of male lead trying to find true love, Or at least Normal love.
Can't get over that title, When you watch the movie, And you should it has girls and romance and funny bits thru out,You will wonder ""WHY or Why ?"" Did they name it that...
Matthew James ( Merl  on ANGEL  tv series) is very likable and makes sense out of this love-starved artist role and has some good luck in bed too.
Sadie Katz (AB Buddy spokesmodel ) has A DEMI MOORE-esque vibe and seems a whole person in character,Not someone off a written page.
Jacqui Holland has an uncredited role as a sidewalk pickup, She and her tattoo make some very funny moments early on in film.
So, Icky title, Great premise and actors capable of making it almost 'sweet romance'."

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"Just switched my cat to this food and he really likes it. He's eating it more than the Purina One Beyond he upgraded from. The vet suggested to give him Innova Evo or Blue Buffalo which are both excellent foods but he didn't like them and he actually dropped down to 9.5 lbs. He's slowly gained weight back after switching to Purina One Beyond but I wanted to buy something that was a great quality food rather than the supermarket junk he likes. Purina One Beyond is better quality than Friskies or something but still not the quality I want my pets to eat.

He is now 10.6 lbs and rising so I'm hoping that he'll eventually get up to the 12 lbs that the vet wanted him at to be ideal weight (he's a large breed cat).

Price was $3 more expensive than the Purina, so he gets a 5 star food at a great price!
I noticed that other reviewers said their cats' poop smelled horrible after eating this but Ziggy's poop doesn't smell horrible or strong at all. Probably just depends on your cat I guess. My other cat sneaks some of his food sometimes and it didn't change her poop either. She uses a pee pad because she refuses to use a litter box so I'd definitely notice if her poop smelled stronger!"

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"5 stars for customer service! Like many other reviewers on this product, the battery from Anker lasts about 7-8 months before the battery starts to swell up and making the mouse track un-clickable and the battery drains out in under 35 minutes. I contacted AnkerDirect recently through their seller page and told them about my battery issue. They asked for pics of the the battery and sent me a return label to mail in the old battery for a replacement covered under the warranty. Easy Peasy. If only all companies were this awesome. I would deal with AnkerDirect again in a heartbeat.

Now for the product itself...4 stars. I have a mid 2010 macbook, and its basically been hanging onto its electronic life by a thread. When I had to replace the original battery that came with my macbook, I didn't want to invest in a Apple battery because I wanted to only squeeze out another 18 months with my mac before upgrading to a new laptop. So this was the way to go for me, especially with the warranty. After installing, it worked great and held a charge for a good 2-3.5 hours depending on how many apps/windows were open until around the 7 month of use. If purchasing this battery keep in mind that there is a chance that you will have to replace it within a year through the warranty. If it's not a big deal to you, don't hesitate and get this battery."

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Faces is a party game played in rounds. In the first three rounds, six pictures are shown of men, women and animals, respectively. Some of the animals look better than the people, and I'm not kidding!! The people pics are B&W and are from the 19th century, judging from the fashion styles seen. In turn, each player chooses one of the pictures to respond to a question asked, like ""Which one looks the grumpiest?"" Others try to guess which picture that played picked. You get to advance on the game board if you do. Then in another round, two pictures are shown, and the person whose turn it is must guess which of the two pictures a certain player submitted. First one to reach the Finish space wins.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I added one of these hardwired Kidde/Firex CO alarms in our basement in the general area of the oil burner just in case there is ever a problem with flue gasses backing up. I have it interconnected with two other KN-COB-IC carbon monoxide alarms and four Kidde/Firex SA320CN Dual-Sensor smoke alarms located throughout the rest of the house. This CO alarm has a 9v battery backup in case of power interruption and will sound along with the other interconnected CO alarms when one of them detects a high CO level. It has its own distinct sound pattern to differentiate it from the sound the smoke alarms make. However, this CO alarm is apparently designed so that it will not also sound the interconnected smoke alarms, which would mean if you only had one of these CO alarms installed in a remote location of your home, like a basement, it may not be able to alert people in other areas of the building when it activates. So, the ideal solution would be to have one of these interconnected CO alarms on each floor in addition to smoke alarms. The alarm has a built in end of life notification feature that alerts you when it needs replacement with two chirps every 30-seconds. The Amazon product description above says this occurs after seven years of operation, but the actual User's Guide that came with it says ten years, so not sure which is correct. Overall, this CO alarm seems decently made and was fairly reasonably priced. Of course I hope to never actually have it activate from high CO levels in our home, but it's good to know it is there just in case.

Update: According to Kidde's website, the KN-COB-IC carbon monoxide alarms manufactured as of 2013 now have a 10-year end of life cycle, not 7-years as indicated in the product description above."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Note that ""adjustable"" means the fit, using hook-and-loop closures, onto the body part.  These are not the type of weights which allow addition and removal of sandbags to adjust the weight.
The outside is a lycra-type material, making the weights comfortable against the skin.  They stay on well--I use them for ankles--but are easy to get on and off.  If your exercise or physical therapy routine requires quick change of weights, I recommend these.  Switching these off with a 2-1/2 pound pair easier than adding and removing sandbags in the truly ""adjustable"" set I own."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Stellar product. Bought for use with a Surface Pro 4.. had to futz a bit with the video drivers on the surface.. but once I fixed it, this has worked flawlessly. the quality is amazing. Theoretically, any Miracast capable device, i.e. an Intel processor with video of recent vintage (<2 years) should work with it, but I have yet to test this.

Basically, your device creates a direct WiFi connection over 2.4ghz to the device itself.. thus the connectivity is a dedicated network using a streamlined protocol..the result is, or Screen Sharing, it runs circles around Chromecast, DLNA and even AppleTV which all attach to the network and packets/data are pushed over tcp/ip."

I do not believe the publisher should be allowed to get away with writing a book that is so clearly written and so clearly in the mind of the reader.  This is a book that should be read by everyone.

I did not feel the need to comment on the content of the book because I have already read it and I am not sure if I will continue to read it.  I have read other books by the author but this one, which I have read before, was a great addition to my library.  I do not think it is necessary for a book to be a good introduction to the topic of drug abuse.  It is a great book to read for anyone who has a history of drug abuse.  I look forward to reading more books by this author.Very good story.  I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good story that is not too long and full of good characters.

I noticed the display was a little dim.
I changed the batteries and it's nice and dark again not to mention it set itself within 5 minutes.
I got a little under 3 years from a set of cheap Sunbeam AA batteries.
One battery still tests good and one was starting to leak which is probably why the display was getting dim.
The clock is still accurate in time and date so I'd call this a great purchase."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I am a die hard fan of Gezer!! I purchased a pair of their ""Black Roses"" sandals over a year ago & from the first time I wore them it has been my go to sandal over all! I had this pair on my wish list for awhile, but I had a few polo, guess & Ocean Pacific sandals at the time so I put off buying for a moment....to my total surprise, the Black Roses by Gezer lasted longer than all the sandals I paid much more for...and none of them had a guided foot support or an arch like these do. I live in the southwest & I wear sandals even in the winter, and I walk an insane amount as I am in a personal weight loss program & walking is the kindest to my joints which have issues from my serious athletic days of basketball, performance dance, ballet & cheerleading...so I walk everyday, everywhere  up to 2-3 miles depending on my schedule and Gezer holds up and because of the arch & toes supports they are comfortable the entire time. I also bought another pair of Black Roses because my once chubby foot has shrunk considerably during my weight lose & the leather straps were too big, but still in beautiful condition!! The sole was even barely worn, after a year of almost daily user!!  I passed them onto my niece as she is pregnant & has chubby feet  now (: She put them on & immediately said...""OOOO, these are soo pretty!! AND comfortable!! ) These sandals are well made, durable, aesthetically pleasing and a steal for the price....not even my Bill Blass slip-ons are comparable. The ""red"", is not a red...it is light pink & dark pink with white accents, but I wanted pink, so...works for me. True to size. I wear a 8-9 & got a size Euro 40. LOVE THEM LOVE THEM LOVE THEM!!

Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"Sorry can't give a good review when the product you get is different than what is shown in the photos. Tri legs are a standard in photography because they add stability compared smaller 4 leg base. Why would Fotodiox change this to a 4 leg design is beyond me. Also why have they not updated the photos, could it be because they know most photographers will look at other products if they do. It's nice that the legs fold but poor design that putting the spigot on the the top leg takes away the ability to fold the legs for storage and transport. It seems the early positive reviews are from before Fotodiox changed the product without updating the description or photos."

I used to wear it everyday and it still feels like it's working.  This is still the same plastic part and it's still holding up well.Works as expected.  Great price for the quality.  I just wish it came with a charger.Great.  I like that the cradle is very convenient and holds the tablet in place without having to pull it out.  Great case.  I use this with my Canon Rebel T3i and it fits perfectly.  I love the tablet feature, but I wish it was a bit bigger.I bought this to replace my old Sony DSLR and it was a steal!  It's very small, with good features.  The camera is pretty small, but not too big.  The grip is nice and comfortable, and the camera is very easy to use.  The button on the side is a little hard to reach, and it's very easy to hit with your fingers.  The back of the camera is a little more comfortable than the front, but not as much as I thought it would be.  I am pleased with the quality.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"The vast majority of international terrorism conducted on a spectacular scale is State-sponsored. A faction or network of government uses its access to the levers of power to promote actions in various ways. As withe the Red Brigades the Baader-Meinhof faction showed their gullibility because both groups were created by and controlled by NATO intelligence. Thus terrorism in the modern era is the means by which oligarchies wage secretwars against peoplewhich it would be politically impossible to wage openly. In Germany, Detlev Karsten Rohwedder was the cheif of thr Trusteeship Agency which in 1991 was the largest corporation in the world. In the communist German Democratic Republic(GDR) collapsed in 1989, all industry that was property of the state & was transferred to the Trusteeship Agency. Rohweeder, as the haed of this entity, preferred to keep the vast state property of the GDR as a state sector to maintain existing levels of employment and production so as to facilitate the absorbtion of the East German regions into a unified Germany. Anglo-American financiers wanted all the GDR state property to be put on the auction block at once, so that it could be sold off at bargain basement prices to Wall Street & the City of London. When Rohwedder proved reluctant to accept this policy he was assinated by elements claiming to be the Baader-Meinhof group. Rohwedder's successor immediately began selling off GDR state property the way the City of London/Anglo Americans wanted. Two other celebrated signature cases are the elimation of Enrico Mattei, the president of the Italian state oil company and the German banker Juergen Ponto by the Baader-Meinhof gang  protrayed well in this movie. It is evident that the Baader-Meinhof was acting asa false-flag operation for CIA and MI-6. Putting this as a backdrop the the film increases its importance significantly and allows the viewer to connect the missing dots."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"My 5 year old and my 3 year old really enjoyed the DohVinci Deluxe Styler.  They played with it back and forth between them for around an hour. There was a little bit of fighting over who's turn it was so you know they liked using it.

The Play-Doh that comes out of the tubes is not traditional Play-Doh. It's a softer compound making it easy enough for kids to squeeze. The Styler gun is simple to use; the kids didn't need any help changing it out. My 3 year old was able to do it a couple of times, but couldn't after his hands were reportedly ""wet"". I'm not sure if he had been putting his fingers in his or just clammy kid hands. I don't know why, sometimes kids just got clammy hands, they don't know either. Anyway aside from ""wet"" hands the kids were able to completely utilize the DohVinci Styler.

Another point about it not being traditional Play-Doh is that it's not reusable.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Fast Diet is the best weight loss book I have read in a very long time. It has a practical approach and it is not full of unrealistic goals that are impossible to keep, like most of the diet books out there. I have been searching for the diet to work for me and after a lot of books with unrealistic methods and goals, I have finally found one that I believe will work for me. I showed my mom this book and this is the same weight loss approach that she has been using and she has been losing weight very steadily. I'm so excited to start. With no major holidays coming up, I'm going to start immediately. Another thing I really liked about the book is how the author tells more about herself and her life than just the diet period. It makes it so much easier to relate to. The cute pictures were just an added bonus. I loved it and will share it with my friends and family. If you haven't gotten it yet..... What are you waiting for. Get on the road of being the you that want to be."

Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"For the most part this thing works by catching food and water from spilling out from the bowls. There are a few annoyances with this feeder, however:

- The top light part and the bottom dark part are two separate pieces with no clips or latches. it simply sit's on top loosely and my 8 week old puppy has pushed it out from the bottom part a few times.

- There are no easy way to pick this tray up. If you grab the top part you'll simply lift it away from the bottom part. You'll have to use to hands or hold at an awkward angle to pick up both trays.

- The rubber feets are loose and not securely attached to the tray. One fell out at some point and now the tray wobbles when the puppy tries to eat.

- The last thing is the bowls are very light or it has no method to secure the bowls from moving around when the dog tries to eat or simply being lifted completely out of the hole.

These things hard to see from the listing and only discovered after using for a week. It still works fine besides those annoyances. Some pros are my puppy likes to bite the walls like a chew toy."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"So, I've never read any of Dimon's work, but the blurb had me SUPER interested to see what would happen. I have to say I was NOT let down in the slightest. Although this book was slightly slow to start, and it took me about 5 or 6 chapters to see the charm in Wren, the ending had my eyes bugged out of my head and my heart beating wildly.

Emery, I loved her. She was strong, compassionate, and dealt with Wren in ways I don't think I would have been able to (as much as I would love the smokin' hot scenes with him). I loved Garrett and his personality is all me! He's an amazing side character. Wren, of course I loved. His weird, non-humanesque traits made him endearing to me.

I most def recommend this book for anyone looking for something a little bit different. You won't be let down.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Extremely well packaged. Very thick outside box, then another inside box, thick cardboard protection top and bottom. On the small side but I knew that. Step for lid works very well and does not tip even when empty. Soft closing lid is nice also. Must use the plastic liner as the bottom is not solid but that is no issue for me since I wanted something that would not rust from my empty, but wet, contact lens packs. Update:  Been several months now and although it sounds foolish, this is one of my favorite items ever purchased on Amazon. The plastic liner is very simple to remove and dump and clean if needed. I do not feel a need to use a plastic bag. The lid opens and closes softly and smoothly each and every time. No need to keep your foot on the pedal to lower the lid."

I have light colored floors that show dirt easily so these kept the floor clean.

The booties are very well packaged in separate cylinder bundles. This is convenient so you can keep in attractive containers by the door, ready to be used by your guests. The little bundles themselves come in a plastic bag, nothing fancy.

The quality is good. They have light treads though not sure if they make much of a difference in grip.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I have three dogs, and I am constantly hiking. But I also have pronation and require orthotics and a good, sturdy boot to hike without spraining my ankle every other step.

I have two pairs of Merrell Women's Moab Mid Waterproof Hiking Boots, and I still wear both of them. The first pair, I ordered a year ago, and though I'm out in them every day, the tread still looks brand new.

They are very reliable, even out in the rain. My first pair only lost it's ""waterproof"" viability when I had to walk in two feet of water on a hike. And I'm sure they probably could be sprayed with waterproofing spray to get them back into shape; I just haven't done it yet. If you know you're going to be out in a constant torrential downpour, rain boots are more appropriate, but these should keep you dry unless you're walking in water.

I mentioned that I have pronation, and this can make me very prone to spraining my ankle. These boots have a good mid-height that keep my ankles secure, but they're not so stiff that they cause chafing. You'll find when you first get them that they're only a little stiff, and one or two walks will probably be enough to break them in.

Both my pairs are a half-size larger, and I did this based on other reviews. I highly recommend this as well, as I find that if I'm wearing bulky socks, they can rub a little on my outer toes even at a half-size larger.

They're very comfortable. Not exactly walking on clouds, but your feet are definitely are not going to hurt after five or six hours on the trails. I wear Doc Martens to work (office work, but I'll never wear heels), and when I slip the Merrells on, they do feel like slippers.

I have worn several other waterproof day-type boots (leading brands), and I lost treads and the boots fell apart quickly. These are definitely for the long haul and worth every penny."

Once I get an added amp for the components, I will see how they do with 200W, they will probably be able to handle more volume and distortion with more power available.

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"The Help is an amazing story - that was not told at all by the movie. They left out the SERIOUS dangers that these women faced. There was no character development with Minnie, Leroy, Stuart, Miss Celia... Very disappointing. Skeeter's mother was made out to be a good person with a good heart deep down in the movie, but the book shows what a terrible person she really is - which made Skeeter's decisions and life even more difficult.
I'm happy the book is getting so much press - but REALLY don't understand why the movie is."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"The description says it will get you to 120 PSI. In my experience, it's nearly impossible to get the pressure in over 70 psi with this pump. Good enough for triage, but not ideal.

Based on other positive reviews, it seems that three things are possible:

1. User error by me (I don't *think* that's the case, but i'm not so arrogant as to rule it out). I would guess I am at least slightly physically stronger than the average user of this pump, so I don't think that's the issue either.
2. Poor quality control (some people get great ones, a few get lemons)
3. Widespread dishonesty/pay-to-review arrangements (I haven't looked for evidence of this, but I have seen other unrelated products fall victim to this).

At $25 it's not a super value, so I am less inclined to cut a break. I'm not going to toss it, but I wouldn't buy again either."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"A First Rate Madness: Uncovering the Links between Leadrship and Mental Illness is a book you might want to read.  Some will find the historical illustrations thin while others may find the analysis provided a stretch in place, but Nassiar Ghaemi has published one interesting book.  Ghaemi is the director of the Mood Disorder Program at Tuft Medical School.  Using available historical and medical evidence, he argues that various mood disorders can be  linked to success in leadership situations.  In individual sections he takes up creativity, realism, empathy, and resilience.  He finally takes up treatment and mental in general.  Along the way, he illustrates his views using the lives of well known persons including Bush, Blair, Nixon, JFK, Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, Lincoln Churchill.  Just the character sketches that Ghaemi uses is worth the price of the book.  This is one of the more thought provoking books that I have read in the past couple of years.  Readers will approach leadership differently after completing this volume."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"I just received this book 10 minutes ago so I am unable to comment on how thoroughly it covers the basics. It appears to have a lot of detail on how to use the program.

However, be warned it is only a ""user"" guide, it has absolutely no ""tech"" info such as information on how to install or upgrade. If you have a previous version of Quickbooks and want to know any gotcha's about what happens to your data while upgrading (or how to get your data migrated into the new version) this is not the guide. If you are concerned about advanced topics such as 64-bit systems or server-based versus desktop-based or how to lock it down so everyone in the company doesn't have to be a super-user just to use the software this type of information does not appear to be in this book. There is some coverage on managing users in chapter 26 but little on how to make multi-user work so more than one person can use the software at a time and what the issues/limitations are,

In summary - if you have already got your computer guy/gal to install and set it up for you, this looks to be the right book for you. If you have an unopened box or are trying to understand what the install instructions mean, it is not and you will need additional info."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"By reputation, Meryl Streep seals her legend in this hardly observed crime who-dunnit receiving no Oscar nod or Academy mention for a performance that is astoundingly real in its exactness in the character of Lindy Chamberlain charged with the murder of her own daughter in the Australia back water, near Alice Springs, along with her husband Michael (Sam Neill), both devout Christians, a case that was solved a year after the picture's release. It is one thing to capture the virtuosity of Streep, but to present the trials and tribulations of innocent, accused parents under the microscope of media and bombarded by innuendo at every turn wearing testimony and beliefs to the pressure point is an extraordinary piece of cinema. If you followed this film with ""Silkwood"" you would see two distinct individuals played by the same actress. And, of course, Meryl Streep continues to stretch our imaginations. The supporting cast is familiar to those who fancy Australian offerings. However, this film is unique in its documentary feel with artistic touches, like complete authenticity to the decent character of the principals, that heighten its impact. Here, the viewers as well as the lead characters are tested by fire and survive. This is a Streep performance you must see."

If you know how to pair a Bluetooth device, you know how to use this. It's that simple. It's also small and light, so no hassle there.

I paired it with my Galaxy S7. It took less than 30 seconds start to finish. Per the instructions, open your camera app and push the appropriate shutter button (there's one for iDevices and one for Android). In my case, either button worked just fine. YMMV. Much better than using the hand gestures that are baked in to the S7, in my opinion.

But one thing for sure Darwinist get mad at any one who has evidence against evolution and in favor of a counter theory. Ben could done better. He could interview Dr Sanford. He is geneticist and could provide much needed TESTABLE evidence to the movie. I high encourage you to read genetic entropy & mystery of the genome. The problem Ben stein did not know of Dr Sanford work. Most people don't. It way most scientist think Neo Darwinian evolution is even possible.

It IS absolutely positively beautiful. Looks to be well made. But has been problematic from the get go. My first one came defective (leaked internally). Getting a replacement was easy through Amazon. But, I still had to pay the plumber twice.

Worked great for about 6 months, then the sprayer started leaking. My bad for not contacting the company. It continues to leak, particularly if water is on high. In addition, it doesn't like to stay seated in the holder. Very disappointing. I love the faucet. Wish it worked better. Needs a bit of a design redo in my opinion."

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"I'm not a purist, I thought where LOTR deviated from the book it was done to good effect and often brought in material and character background from Tolkien's own notes.

The Hobbit movie does not have the same reverence for the source material.  Clearly the makers thought the book story was too boring for modern viewers so they turned it into an action-and-adventure movie with no subtlety or sense of discovery.  Orcs are brought in much earlier in the story to tack on fight scenes and drive the party (rather than boring old cold and hunger).  Computer animated scenes and cutesie additional characters are thrown in to market to kids.  The action in the stone giants scene is right out of Transformers and the orc dungeons are shown as vast Moria-like caverns to allow gratuitous animated tracking shots.

The beginning of the Gollum scene was the end of the movie for me.  Instead of Gollum creeping out of the gloom, he is introduced in a made-up action scene and the ring pops out of his pocket in a flash of animated effects so no one can miss it.

If I was a purist I'd give it one or two stars but if you take it as a standalone action movie and not an adaptation of a great book it's not bad.  So I'm giving it a 3.  Just don't expect the experience you had with LOTR."

I was curious about the hour-long video about the history of the Care Bears as well as the cartoon that has been rediscovered and restored for the first time in several decades.  But my 3-year-old grand-daughter had other things in mind than watching historical, or history-making, movies.  This Care Bear proved the right companion to get her to bed and end her pestering us for more presents.  In short, this aristocratic but convivial Barney might be just as appropriate for a bear-deprived, discerning and appreciative adult as a child.  It would probably even make a bear-lover out of Stephen Colbert.  Now I'm wishing I'd secretly bought this classy if not classic bear for myself and purchased the less expensive purple Care Bear for my grand-daughter who, none the wiser, would have been none the less content."

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"What can I say? I'm a 5'6"" 40-something eventer with big horses and having a mounting block sure makes setting and resetting fences much easier.  I used to have a three-step block and unfortunately, the friend to whom I loaned it managed to break it (yep, really!).  So, missing my block, I ordered this one.  At first, I missed having that top third step, but after a week or so, I got used to it.
What I like:  Stability.  I have a youngster who is learning to stand still for mounting, and this block has a nice, wide base, so it doesn't move around easily.  I can get on and off 20 times, holding a fidgety youngster, and this block never threatens to tip over.  The steps themselves are plenty wide enough to allow for standing (not just stepping) on them.  The handle is built into the front instead of the back, which makes the block easier to pick up.  While substantial enough in weight, it's light enough to pick up and carry across the arena in one hand (while leading a horse with the other hand) without any real effort.

What I don't like:  I wish it were about 2"" taller.  Also, the recessed area on the back side (not visible in the product photos on Amazon) will make a very attractive nesting location for yellowjackets - a better design would be a straight side all the way down the back.  And finally, the steps are either slightly warped or designed to have a slight depression in the middle of each step.  This means the mounting block collects water and must be tipped off before using after a rainstorm.  I suspect this is a design element to enhance step stability, but the problem of water collection could be eliminated by drilling a small hole in the middle of the depression (I may do this myself)."

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"The hero of this novella was perfect.  He was romantic, masculine, loving, etc. and so I read this story mostly to get to his happily ever after.  The heroine was annoying.  I'm a little tired of the cliche storyline where the woman doesn't want to get involved with cop/firefighter/generic hero because of the possibility of future loss.  It's a bit over the top and has been done many times over.  My biggest issue with the heroine is that she would leave her husband without any explanation.  Who would do that?  And why would he want her back.  But, this is a romance so the play acting that they have to do in front of the heroine's family is funny and there is a happily ever after."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I have bought this type of fuel for years not only for myself but for my wine and coffee cafe. I also have several different fireplace types I use it in. My customers love the ambience of the flame and best of all no flue needed. Some fuel in the past by other vendors produced soot. Probably too much oil in the mix. The fuel is not just alcohol you know. The colored flame comes from the oil/alcohol mix. The right mix gives you a great flame. This product is the best I've used in a long time. Very little cleaning of the glass on some fireplaces. And it's less expensive.

Highly recommend this product. Will be buying regularly."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Emily's Passion is very emotional, personal, and inspiring on many levels.  As a 56 year old woman, I can say that the author really ""gets it"" about keeping the passion in your life way past what many people think you can.  It's a story that really appeals to women as it addresses the challenges of life, losing someone you truly adored, and then managing somehow to find somebody else who can fill the void in your life that you never thought could ever be found again.  In fact, if it was not for the light BDSM elements in the story, this could actually be made into a movie for Lifetime, Hallmark, or Up."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This is exactly what I wanted.  I was looking for a bedspread that would be long enough to hide the metal bed rails--the bed has a headboard but no side rails or foot board.  I've been using a dust ruffle for years and, honestly, the tucking of all of the blankets, making sure the dust ruffle doesn't get caught up in the tucking, was very aggravating.  Especially since my toddler grandson naps in this bed at least twice a week.  I wanted a simpler way to make the bed after nap without having to tuck all of the blankets in.  The bed is queen size and after measuring, I determined that a queen size spread would not work--they are typically sized for use with dust ruffles or on beds with side rails and foot board.  I ordered a king size spread and turned it so the long edge runs across the width of the bed instead of the length of it.  Because there is no pattern that would dictate it be used the way it was intended, this works just great.  The spread is top quality.  After making sure it was the right fit, I washed it and put it on the bed.  It's just perfect and washed beautifully.  No odd smell, no excessive lint, no missed stitching.  This purchase also had the option of buying standard size pillow shams (king spread with standard OR king shams), which I did.  My toddler's bed looks great and will be easy to make as he gets in and out of it. I am going to check to see if it comes in other colors so I can order another one for change of seasons.  You won't go wrong with this purchase."

It's stainless steel so it will match any kitchen decor. It's very attractive so it can be displayed on the table or put in the cabinet with the spices. It's pretty lean so it won't take up much space but it held more oil than I expected.
I put Olive Oil in it (not the person) and it won't great. It was easy to spray after one or two priming pumps. The oil comes out in a line, I wish there was a way to make it have more of a spray but the oil does come out very easily. So I used the olive oil as a pot coating like a cooking spray.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I have been using this product for more than two weeks now. In that time, I've had an opportunity to evaluate both the quality of the product and the overall usability. In creating this review I've considered both the type of material used in making the product as well as the overall fit and finish. I've also considered how well the product meets my needs and whether there are any shortcomings or particular advantages in using this product.

For this particular product, the type of material used in the manufacture and creation of the product seems to be of very good quality. One must consider that for any product of this type there is a balance between the type of material used and the cost that is to be passed on to the consumer. I think for this product that balance has been met fairly well and I believe that the product will meet the expectations of most buyers.

With regard to the fit and finish of this particular product, I believe it to be about average for the products of similar make or style. That is to say that it is not of poor or moderate craftsmanship/finish nor is it something that I would rate as outstanding. The quality of the piece is such that I feel it is a good value for the money.

Finally, as with many products of this type, the value that a consumer sees is dependent on the expectation. When I ordered this product my expectations were moderate, especially because of the price. In an age where we demand low price but often want high quality, it is often best if we expect moderate to good quality instead. I did that with this product as was pleasantly surprised to find that the quality was at least good, if not just a tad bit better than good. For that reason, and those set out above, I'd make a recommendation to buy this product."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"For once its nice to have a hot breakfast at work.

I almost never have time to make breakfast in the mornings so I usually take a granola bar or a piece of fruit. Now that I have this neat little set of Crackin' Egg cookers I can enjoy a hot meal at my desk and it takes less than thirty seconds. Its super easy to use. Just make sure to poke the yolk with a fork so it doesn't explode in the container. I also found that if you spray the container with a little non-stick cooking spray that the egg comes out cleaner.

The only gripe I have with these microwave egg cookers is that I haven't been able to make an egg that isn't over hard. I've tried cooking it at thirty seconds instead of the recommended thirty to fourt-five. But it still comes out over cooked. I think I'll be trying the scrambled egg recipe but other than that I still enjoy a hot and nutritious breakfast. I'm thinking this would be great for someone with kids because you could pop it in the microwave in the morning and take it with you in the car. They're very portable.

Overall I think these are a cool way to make a super fast breakfast that is nutritious as well as delicious.

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"Our Vet recommended these Pill Pockets for our 4 kittens when we switched from using a topical flea medication to a pill form.  When we got home, I placed my order and I was excited to see how this would work!  When this product was delivered, I quickly tore open the package to see what it looks like and exactly how it smells.  Well, I was bummed when all the pill pockets were smashed together instead of being individually separated into a pill pocket form.  However, I did make it work by tearing off a piece, rolling it into a ball and then I placed the pill inside of the ball I made.  I would have returned it but, I did not want to wait any longer since the kittens were overdue on this medication. As for how it smells, it really does not smell like a Salmon flavor to me anyways.

Out of the 4 kittens, 3 loved the pill pockets and wanted more!  Each kitten had their own pill because of their weight so, I kept them separated.  My first kitten, loved the pill pocket, she swallowed it with the pill included.  I was very happy and thought this would be a breeze! Not so much, LOL!  The second kitten ate the pill pocket but, he spit out the pill so, I tried it again and the same thing happened.  The exact same thing happened with the third kitten!

So, 3 kittens out of 4 love the pill pocket taste but, where smart enough to know that there was a pill inside. Needless to say, it was a very funny experience!  Not to mention what it took us to finally get them to take their pill!"
Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"Desire: The Dining Club: Part One is the first short story in an eight part series. Since this is a short story, this review will be brief.

I don't really have much to say about it. The writing isn't awful, but it grows a bit redundant, vocabulary-wise (for example, David says a lot of things quietly).

My main issue is as follows: nothing happens in this first book. It feels like someone took the first chapter of a novel and released it independently. This first part only discusses what the club is, and that Grace is to visit. You don't really learn about the characters much and they come off as cold.

This novella gets two stars based on the concept. I'd very much like to see how this goes. However, I'm not going to collect pieces of eight like it's some kind of literary trading card. I'd rather just wait until they're all out and read them as one full length book than sit through snippets like this. I'd very much recommend that other readers do the same.

Thanks to Netgalley and Forever (Grand Central Publishing) for my copy in exchange for an honest review."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,CG,"Updated review three years later. I love the look and fit of this bra. I ordered the size 6. 5 and it fit perfectly. The fit is perfect. The only thing I would change is that the size 6. 5 is a tad bit snug. The bra straps are a little tight on the chest, but the cups are not. I like the way it looks on my son. I bought these for my husband. He loved them and they fit great. I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loved it and it was great!I'm a huge fan of the rose gold that I've bought at the top of this boot. The reason I bought this boot was because it has a lot of cushioning. I've had a few pairs of this boot and the ones that I've had have stayed on my feet well. It was very well made and was just right for my husband. He has a wide foot and this boot is perfect for that. I'm 5'4"", 130lbs and these boots are a little narrow for him. He's tall and they're a little tight on him, but he's not afraid to wear them. The material is thin and durable and the leather is very soft. I bought them for my husband and he's a bit disappointed that they didn't come up a size bigger. I'm 5'2"", 130lbs and I'm a big guy and these boots are perfect. They fit him perfectly and they're comfortable. I'd recommend these boots for any occasion."

Not terribly concerned, it had a slight, pleasant odor, and I washed my hands. Several cubes were broken into smaller pieces. All pieces are definitely usable for effective fire starting. Have not tried out as yet, reviewed videos about them before purchasing and don't expect to be disappointed. Will try wet cubes next, before deciding for myself which works best. As I said, after reviewing videos of other peoples experience using these, over other products, decided to order, Only gave 4 stars because of residue and broken pieces.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"The Gideon Affair

Gideon Shaw is the sexiest man in Hollywood,  every man wants to be him and every woman wants to do him.  He has a very successful career with endless opportunities but the only things that mean the world to him are his family and his best friend and personal assistant Paige Turner.  He has loved her for as long as he's known her but he can't cross that line.  He can't risk losing her friendship if anything goes wrong.  And let's face it, he's an actor in Hollywood, plenty can and will go wrong.

Paige Turner is a Cornell University graduate that could do anything she desires in the business world.  When she came to L.A., the last thing she would have imagined doing was working as a PA for an actor.  But this actor wasn't just anyone.  In fact, Paige had almost single handedly invented this persona and without her, Gideon Shaw would not be the box office phenomena he is today without her.  She loves him but she can't let him know.  She values her friendship too much to even think about allowing him to learn her true feelings about him.

And then fate stepped in and threw them both for a loop.  They had to decide if the disasters that can only happen in Hollywood would destroy them or if they would come together and find a way to turn their friendship into something so much more than either of them was willing to admit could be possible.

Suzanne Halliday's story takes you through the challenges of a young couple that share love for one another but do not know how to tell each other how they feel without losing what they have and each other.  You will see how sex, drugs and the debauchery of Hollywood can affect a blooming relationship.  You will feel a variety of emotions reading this story but I promise you, you will enjoy every minute of it!"

The only drawback is Jack-the main character is gay and they show lots of scenes of him with other men.  That was a little weird and disquieting, but that's my bigotry showing.  Original plots and great casting.  Jack, I hate to say, was not a very good actor, but nice to look at.  The supporting cast were all excellent actors.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This review is for the charger purchased for a Samsung Galaxy S6. I am very very happy with this purchase, and cannot believe I didn't have this cable before! Like most people, I was using the charger that came with my phone which had frayed beyond belief in the 8 or 9 months that I have had it. Not sure why Samsung doesn't make more durable cables, but I guess they bank on the fact that you'll need to buy a new charger every year or so. But I digress. So my current charger was basically frayed in the section right where it connects to the phone part, so there was a 'particular' way you had to lay the phone for it to properly charge. This left many situations where the phone was plugged in all night, but it wasn't actually charging because the cable wasn't lying in the right position. Annoying, right?
So I was browsing Amazon in it's splendid glory late one night, as I've come to do recently, and decided to order this. Was pleasantly suprised! These are some durable cables! They don't seem flimsy, even at the USB and plug-in part. And the cable is loooooong. How was I tethered to the short, 1 ft charger all this time?
I really feel like I've been living under a rock, because this seems to solve all the problems of the original charger all at once!
 I like that there's a three-pack because, let's be real, my husbands charger is in no better state. And most importantly, because I'm sure this is an issue for many people, it doesn't seem to take longer to charge the phone. Now I haven't done an actual timing of it, but it seemed to take the same amount of time for me. And again, if the cable is in good shape and not finicky, there's less chance that it's just plugged in and not actually charging. I am very happy and will re-purchase these if they ever get destroyed. although whatever would destroy these would likely take the phone with it."

Be Mine, Cowboy by Jane Porter
Cade is a recovering alcoholic who is back in Rachel's life after walking out on her five years ago when she attempted to help him with his problems. In the five years since her heart was broken, Rachel has been struggling to raise her autistic son, doing everything she can to protect him from people who don't understand him. Now that Cade is back she is struggling with feelings that never went away and has to decide whether or not she can trust him not only with her but also with her son.

Be Mine, Cowboy is a sweet, emotional read. Rachel's love for her son is evident in everything she does and you really feel for her and the issues that can come with raising a special needs child. Cade knows that he hurt Rachel when he left and is doing what he can to make amends and win Rachel back. I really enjoyed their story and Jane did a great job. My only wish is that it was a longer story.

Hill Country Cupid by Tanya Michaels
Tess is known for doing what she can in helping out her friends in giving them a push towards something that they want. She's known Nick for several years and decides that he needs help in courting the woman he's lusted after since high school. While helping Nick become more comfortable in flirting with the opposite sex, Tess realizes that she has feelings for Nick but doesn't want to be anyone's second best.

Hill Country Cupid is a nice, fun Valentine's read. I loved Nick and Tess together and seeing them overcome the obstacles keeping them apart. I really enjoyed Nick's determination to show Tess that she is his first choice above anyone else and that they belonged together."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Fits perfectly into any existing train set but is even better as a starter set.

Strangely the green engine that comes with this set is the only train that has a problem passing under the bridge. This is out of 15 different train cars by different makers. On a perfectly flat surface its not an issue but on carpet the green engine must be push/pulled through the overpass.

My other issue is the engines don't have magnets on the front. The Thomas and Chuggington engines all have magnets on the front and back. So there are times they get ignored in favor of other trains that don't have to take the lead. However the trailing cars do have magnets on both sides.

But even taking all that into consideration this is a great buy and I'd definitely suggest it as a beginning point for any child interested in trains."

Nest/Google survey ""encouraged"" me to come here and do it even though my protects have only been installed for about 2 days. I normally would just ignore their desires and do this on my own time but it's annoying enough to share with you. First, nothing ever gets a 5 star review from me without reason. I start at the middle of the road (3 stars in this case) and find reasons to add or subtract from there. So, -1 for annoying marketing department causing me to review this but I kind of understand why... The previous gen 1 protects were a flop from what I've researched. Add 1 point for others reviews saying that these things actually do what they say they are going to do without false alarms. That leaves us at 3/5. Add 1 point for combining multiple smoke and co detection methods. Add another for creating a ""mesh"" network of interconnected detectors that can calmly and efficiently inform me of situations. Subtract a giant 1 point (hard time limiting this to only 1 star) for NOT integrating with other wired detectors. The orange/red wire exists for a reason and that's to kick off alerts in other areas!!

Toys_and_Games_5,2.0,OR,"My daughter loves Rainbow Dash and Play Doh, so I thought this would be a great toy for her, but I'm disappointed with it. In the box, you get the Rainbow Dash, a pair of dough scissors, and 6 very tiny cans of Play Doh in purple, pink, green, yellow, blue, and orange. I did like that the Rainbow Dash has molds built onto it, but they are very hard to get the dough out of, such is the case of the dough extruder on the top of Rainbow Dash's head.

The problem with the extruder is that you can't fit that much dough into the hole and when you push down, the door keeps popping open and when the ""hair"" comes out, it isn't in a continuous flow because you have to keep stopping to add more dough, so it ends up breaking off. Pretty much a bummer for my daughter and we rarely use it. I do really like the scissors and we use them even without the pony and can use the raised designs on them to make impressions in the dough. I also wish that the dough cans it came with were larger because once you mix the colors in the extruder for the hair, it eventually turns an ugly dark color from repeated use of the dough. Lastly, the wings keep falling off of the pony. The idea of the pony is cool, but the execution is quite flawed."

The widow, Lilith Davenant, never knew affection before, or during her marriage.  That has remained unchanged since her wastrel husband's demise.  She is thought of as one icy, stiff, no nonsense lady of high principles and morals.

A wager has been agreed upon whereby the Marquess of Brandon/Julian must seduce the newly betrothed and aloof Lilith within six weeks.  This in order to remove his cousin, Lord Robert, from the clutches of his conniving mistress and avoid family scandal.  And so the games begin.

This is an enjoyable read, but not Ms. Chase's best.  It was quite predictable.  And, although it being quite appropriate for the times and Lilith's moral character, I would have liked at least one full sex scene between the H/h.  I would also have liked an epilogue."

I can see spending maybe $50.00 but no more than that. Unfortunately no one is selling it for less than what it cost, unless it's a used item.

This was bought so I could work on my Abs. That being said, this is not the most comfortable piece of equipment to use to do situps. Yes it helps with your neck and not straining it as you come up from doing a ""situp"" but if you have lower back issues, this will not help you. ....If anything , it'll make your lower back much worse. So I wouldn't recommend this if you have back issues.

I've been using this religiously for the past 3 months and only have 15% bodyfat ( female) and I don't see any ABs. My diet is pretty good ( fruits vegetables lean meats etc) but still no sign of any ABs . Unless I'm supposed to have lower bodyfat which I refuse to go lower than 15% to get these ABs then this thing is just not going to work for me. Lower bodyfat is not the answer for me- to many health risks involved with that.
 I'll give it another month and if I see no signs of ABS then this will be going back to the store."

The author talks about some things that are very familiar to me -- like protein keeping you from getting hungry -- as well as other tips.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"As part of my significant renovation throughout a recently-purchase house, I bought this faucet for my bar sink just two weeks ago.  This faucet was extremely easy to install.  Since I did not have to remove the old faucet (there was no faucet at this sink when I bought the house), it took me all but 10 minutes to have this up and running.  Just put the whole faucet through the sink hole.  Screw in the mounting plate from the below.  Hook up the water supply hoses and you are set.  Please note that I am a fairly typical DIYer not expert, so I think most anybody would be able to install this faucet.

My experience with Amazon has been great.  The box arrived quickly.  Although it is advertised as oil-rubbed bronze, the color is fairly light not as dark as some of the other bronze faucets that I have.  In fact, the picture on Amazon is a lot darker than the actual faucet.  There were also no hoses included with the faucet, so you will need to buy them separately.

Overall, it's a good buy, but only time will tell how it will hold up."

Everyone does a great job as they pursue their individual goals through a landscape studded with bizarre, yet linked incidents. Some of it is contrived, but all good movies are. Sit back, enjoy the ride and watch this movie at least three times to catch all the subtlety. Guy Ritchie is a brilliant director. I only wish he would make more movies."

Through their secondary interactions with the other leads made for a pleasurable journey for the two of them to finally make that step to creating a relationship in Forever, OR. Josh had experienced loss, confusion, and the desire to want what was once his. He knew this look when he saw it on the face of Caroline. There was this draw to Caroline that he could not deny. Finally getting that chance to make things more was the opportunity that he was looking for. Josh captivated me back a few book and the sweetness continues on. The sense of humor was on point and charming. He was all the dream qualities one wants in a man strong, sweet, patient, kind, and protective. His knack for baking pies makes him well liked. It also provides a connection for him and Caroline. I found Josh to my favorite Second Shot hero. He has my heart. Caroline was truly a match for him. Thank you Sara. Where are we heading next?

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Prior to purchasing this kettle I had used an all steel kettle on my flat glass range.  I hate this stove because I have to be so careful heating things (it heats by magnetic induction so if the pot/pan/kettle has no metal, it won't heat it very well).  I had tried this glass kettle flat on the surface but it took 30 minutes to boil water (minimal magnetic stuff in this glass).  I was concerned about it cracking, but it survived as long as I ramped the heat up slowly and didn't just crank it.  I then tried various heat diffusors (cast iron grate, some other wire zig zag thing I had) but the best one is the clover metal wire that came with the kettle.  It now takes 10-15 minutes to boil water (it took 5 minutes in my metal kettle, but then my water tasted like metal).  Even when I straight up crank the stove temp to high, the kettle has shown no signs of breakage.  My only complaint which may be my stoves fault, is that even though no glass is touching the surface, I am still developing a brown halo stain around my burner.  What am I burning?  Air?  is something coming off of the glass?  I doubt it.  But I cant blame the kettle as it is doing its job even on my crummy stove.  Also the clover diffuser burns a stain into the glass, but with enough 409 and some elbow grease, and steel wool, I can get the stains off.

I have only been using this kettle for a month and the handle has not yet loosened, like so many reviewers are complaining.  If anything changes, I will update my review."

I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review.

This is a great book. It is well written and the characters are well developed. This book is a great series for young and old. I have read the first book in the series and it is a great series. I look forward to reading the next book.This is a short novella about a couple who have been separated for years. The story is about a man who is forced to marry his wife in a marriage ceremony after she has cheated on him.

The story takes place in the small town of Fairfield, Illinois.  The town has been plagued with family drama.  The town's neighbors have been killed and the town is in turmoil.  The town is now facing a loss of residents.  When the town takes a chance on a town of its own, the town is able to try and save the town and its residents.

The author does a great job with this story.  The characters are well developed and the story is quick and fun.  I loved reading about the town's neighbors.  I was also very intrigued about the town's history."

Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"I agree with many of all these less-than-impressed reviews of this movie.  I am really getting tired of how todays films depend so much on CGI.  It's just not perfected yet.  It still looks way too cartoonish which is very hard to take seriously.  I miss the sci-fi horror films of the 1980's.  Creating special effects WITHOUT CGI looked more realistic on film back then.

And what's more.  I have yet to see any Will Smith film worth watching twice.  He does ""big budget"" films, but they are generally all pretty lame in appeal.  His ""Wild Wild West"", ""Independence Day"", ""Men in Black"", ""I Robot"", etc.  These are just a few of some pretty lame big box office Hollywood films.

""Hitch"" didn't have any CGI, so I guess what made that film bad was just Will Smith himself.  Well, wait a minute.  It's not that I don't like Will Smith.  I just don't like any of his films.  Any actor could have replaced him in all those films of his, and it will still be an overblown, but still dull movie to me.  I guess I just don't care for his choices in his movie career.  But, I guess he's not hurtin'.  America eats this crap up."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"This has to be one of the best designed and most comfortable bras I have ever worn! As a size 36DD woman, it is very hard to find something that not only has good support, but is feminine and pretty too. This bra designer understands the needs of a heavily busted woman. First of all, they give you an extra hook and eye bra strap extender to allow your bra to fit perfectly throughout a little weight gain or weight loss. No back fat is going to be created by this band not fitting well. The straps are softly padded over the shoulders, so nothing digs in leaving those red strap marks on your shoulders at the end of the day. The underwire supported cups of the bra give full coverage and also great support holding everything at the right height and in place. They are lightly lined for comfort and concealment and the lace and bow accents are very feminine. Nothing shows through your clothing ~ even the lace overlay on the cups. I believe for me this was a perfect fit - it did not run too large or too small. I would certainly love to have a drawer full of these bras, as I personally could not ask for anything better made, more reasonable priced or with a better fit than this bra.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"""Northanger Abbey"" is a wandering book that doesn't really know where it is going.  The first half is typical Austin fare, a heroin at Bath questing for a dear friend and a dearer husband.  The cast of characters is complete; a nutty, vacant aunt,  a dear best friend, a handsome but intolerable man...
Then, it evolves into a biting pastiche of Gothic romance.  It appears a little bit like she got bored with the novel halfway through, and decided to write something more interesting.  The setting changes from society-haunted, frivolous Bath to the dark, shadow-haunted stone walls of Northanger Abbey.
While not as charming as Austin's other books, ""Northanger Abbey"" is enjoyable for all it quirks.  The dialog has that spark of wit necessary for enjoyment, and the writing, while not fully evolved, still evokes the same satisfaction that one gets from later Austin books.
By no means should this be your first Jane Austin novel, but neither should it remain unread."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"I own several Gerber knives, and overall I like the them, Gerber makes a solid knife. However, like most Gerber knives the steel used in this blade is average, 440 high carbon. It does not hold an edge that well and dents/chips fairly easily. The added features, i.e. sharpener/whistle/fire starter are nice. Although the fire starter is crap, it broke on the first use with minimal force used. The sheath is fantastic, more impressive than the blade in my opinion, very durable. The grip of the knife is also quite nice, comfortable and sturdy, no slip at all. All in all if you are an occasional outdoors man and looking for a decent affordable survival knife this is a good buy. But if your looking for a blade thats made of better steel (Aus8) and overall durability and blade retention quality and still at decent price, I would suggest the SOG Seal Pup. No bells and whistles. Just the blade but it's a fantastic knife and if purchased from amazon not much more expensive than the this knife. Basically if you want a knife that if your life depended on it, I would not go with this Gerber, go with an SOG or maybe a Kabar. Bear Grylls is a badass and there is no way he would trust his life to this blade."

Electronics_5,2.0,OR,Got this for Christmas last year. Had 2 6.5s and a bridged 12 hooked up. Ran 0 gauge from battery and ground and 12g to speakers. Worked well for about 6 months. Around July or August it started having issues channels failing in an odd way. Any amp Ive had in the past that has gone bad the channel stayed dead. It developed a whine in one speaker and then channels would randomly cut out until you turned it off for a few minutes and back on again. This would cut out in one channel one day and another on a different day. Rechecked wiring and all is good. Distortion is bad at higher volumes and bass is very muffled. For the price it sounded as expected and for the time it did work it worked ok. I did expect it to last longer than it did.

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"I watched this DVD thinking it was the cure for everything.  It goes round and round about how things can happen if you think positively and attract nothing but positive things and prosperity.  But I didn't understand how.  How do checks come in the mail if you are not due a refund?  If you are forced to hang around or work with negative people, how can you stay so positive?  I have seen the makers of this movie talk on talk shows and they give much more information than is on this DVD.  I think you would need to take a thousand different scenarios and then ask them how to deal with them before you could apply this philosophy because it is very confusing.  Kind of like scientology is so confusing and needs intense instruction to learn, I believe this ""secret"" needs alot more information and instruction to apply it so that it works as it states it does.  I have even bought the book ""The Laws of Attraction"" just so I can better understand the ideas put forth in the movie.  Hopefully it will clear up everything that sounded like a runaround to me."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I've heard a lot about Alisha Rai but I've never actually read any of her work before PLAY WITH ME. Whoo, now I'm starting to think I should correct that...because this book is hot!

Tatiana and Wyatt were teenage lovers. Then they had a bad split. Now, Tatiana is about to contact Wyatt again for the first time in years because, by striking coincidence, it turns out that her biological brother (with whom she recently met for the first time) has gotten in trouble for stealing from Wyatt's casino and he and his young family can't afford the consequences if Wyatt presses charges. Tatiana is hoping to plead her brother's case.

Typed out like that, it kind of sounds like the set-up to some bad porn. Which, technically, I guess it is. PLAY WITH ME is an erotic short, clocking in at just over 100 pages, and about 85% of those pages consist of sex scenes, or build-ups to sex scenes.

But PLAY WITH ME is a cut above most erotica I've read. The characters are well written, with real flaws and insecurities. Their emotions are conceivably realistic. The dirty talk is good. The scenarios are well written, consensual, erotic, and somewhat inventive. Both the hero and heroine get off, and have open communication with one another about what they want and what their expectations are.

I received a copy of this book in exchange for a fair and honest review!

3.5 to 4 out of 5 stars"

The only thing I would change would be to say that I liked the way the story ended. I wanted to go back and read the next book in the series. I would love to see the series continue with the next installment.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I don't much care for having a removable lens cap on a string (like my old 2000-era digicam from Sony), and I wish the zoom was a bit better, but everything else about this camera I love.

It takes the best low-light no-flash pictures of any camera I've had -- finally beating out the old F2.0 Sony camera I had back in 2000. I've looked for years to find something like this, and can finally replace my Fuji F10 (which wasn't as good, but had clean high ISO low-light performance).

And altough I thought I'd hate it, I ended up LOVING the pop up flash -- so convenient compared to toggling computer menu options.

I'm quite impressed. You can see thousands of photos taken using this camera at DisneyFans.com in the Disneyland 2009 gallery."

Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"I think it's a nice little rattle that my 4 months old daughter plays with for few mins each day. It lights up and the lights change colors everytime you tap it so it captures the baby's attention. my daughter loves trying to put the face part into her mouth but since she cant, she settles with just sucking on the ears. She also tries tosuck on the middle part but she cant get to it.. its not long enough and with the two bulky ends, it just doesnt fit her face. When I was buying, I thought it would be a good teething toy also but that didn't work out too well. There is also a mirror on the bottom that my daughter looks at for few mins but why look at the small mirror when you have a color changing face!  Its a cool toy that does what it says it does but at the end of the day, it is regular toy- a rattle, that I am not sure I would pay $20 for. She is just as entertained playing with her $2 rattle, then going out of town on her link of rings as her teething toy!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,I like this better than the finish line I was using. It has a sort of opaque or foamy look to it so you can actually see what it's doing and it hangs on to the chain pretty well. End result cleaner and less waste.

I have many of them. That said, this is just about as good a lantern as I can imagine for any price. It's not lightweight, or pretty, with few options. But, it has a great handle/hanger, is sturdy and steady, provides very pleasing diffuse light, and is bright enough for lots of uses. Also, I gave it to a plumber to use in our crawl space under the bathroom. It gave him plenty of light, but he forgot to turn it off. Crawling under there is a nightmare, so I left it on. He came back 6 days later to finish the job. The light was still burning! That's 144 hours!!! This was on low of course, but I mean really. Regular batteries, too. And I'd already used it a few times before that. Wow."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,The lithium-ion battery allows this to run a long time on a charge. There is however one flaw that hopefully B&D can address. The filter attachment can be confusing to some and the filter may become unattached at which point the motor is sucking in the dirt. A redesign where filter is attached directly to motor housing with positive and fool proof installation would solve this problem. Other than this problem a really great product.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"I have been waiting impatiently for LMR's newest book and was a little disappointed. It was a great plot, great couple but she seemed to spend way too much time on background information and not enough on the characters falling in love or even interacting together. They seemed to only speak twice and the love affair wasn't developed. When they first hooked up romantically I looked down and half the book was already read. I like great dialogue that shows a connection between couples and LMR has ALWAYS delivered. I hope that now that she used 3/4 of this book to set up the plot the next two books will focus on the couples interacting together too."

I'd rather have a cover that's not so thick, and not too thin, but I don't think that's a big deal. The plastic cover is a little too thick for my thumb, so it's difficult to remove it with a single finger, but it's easy to do that.

I wore them around the house with my two-year-old and my 2-year-old and they are very comfortable and well-made.  They are very comfortable and I can wear them all day and on my feet all day long.  I have had to return them because I have a smaller foot, but they fit great, are just right for my needs, and are well-made.

They are not as big as I thought they would be, but they are a good length for my daughter to wear.  I would recommend these for anyone with a smaller foot, but she is a bit of a shoehead in the lower back"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I have the DisplayPort to DVI AmazonBasics cable and the Displayport to HDMI. Both work great. I would suggest either one depending on whether you need DVI or HDMI on the output or monitor side.

The cables that are DisplayPort on one side always have Displayport as the video source and the output or monitor side is the DVI or HDMI. Some other cables will work both ways, but cables with DisplayPort will only work one way.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I have to dress the blade (with aluminum oxide dressing stick) after every few dozen cuts to maintain a minimum amount of blowout in the back of the translucent glass tiles But I think that is pretty standard. Using this in conjunction with a Dewalt wet saw has consistently produced very smooth and accurate cuts. Most cuts are so smooth I do not need to use a sanding stone to smooth the edges of the tiles. Additionally, the blade has allowed me to accurately make U-shaped cut-outs for electrical boxes and NOT have to use tile nippers. The side of the blade is good for grinding sideways along a line so the cut-outs are smooth."

Books_5,1.0,OR,"So glad I bought this book used. I would have been so mad had I paid full price. It is touted as being ""Diabolically Funny"" by the NYT, but I guess that is what they consider funny. I found it to be very sad. A story about upper east side NY parents who have an accessory son who is raised by nannies who have no backbone and as a result are abused by the NY parents. If that's funny I would hate to see what the NYT reviewer thinks is sad. But then again it was set in NY and I guess that is all it takes for the NYT reviewer to think it's funny. Nothing new here. Just a couple of NY writers trying to fascinate us with life in the upper east side of Manhattan and how they think it is funny that apparently many upper east side parents are more driven by money and status rather than raising healthy happy children."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  With each new book in the series, the characters are growing.  This book was different as it was based upon an attack of an Irish rugby hero who isn't dead but is comatose and is married to a well known and loved TV personality.  The mystery was trying to figure out who would want to hurt him and why.

Reilly, Chris and Kennedy struggle to figure it out through all the media hype involving the famous couple.  The forensics crew are working long hard hours going over all the evidence and coming up with very little to go on and a few unknowns...but they are all very intelligent in their own ways and eventually things slowly begin to come together.

In this story, you also get to see a different side of Reilly, as she tries to work through both her personal problems and her career problems.

This was an excellent read and I hope there are more to come ... and soon!  Thank you to the Hill's for this wonderful series,"

Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"This is probably entertaining for a baby who can sit but is not mobile... although it might scare babies that age. Considering the price of this toy and the added cost of the battery needed to run it, I say pass on this toy and buy something else! My daughter got this for her birthday and has played with this probably 15 whole minutes, if that (she is 16 months old now). The motor is so loud you can't hear the music over it, and it just doesn't keep her attention for long at all. The loud noise may scare your kid, it has scared my daughter a few times when she hits it by accident. One thing I like about this toy is when my cats accidentally hit it it goes off and it is pretty hilarious watching them scurry, since they aren't supposed to be in her playroom. Giving it three stars because it does what it advertises it does, but pretty much is boring and not very entertaining for my one year old, and there are cheaper and more entertaining toys out there."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"Zippers fall directly on the knees no matter what adjustments are made (I thought it might be just my height but read identical reviews on other sites).  The manufacturer failed to properly incorporate the zipper, usually there is a smooth ""lip"" of material on either side of the fabric to conceal the seam, but in this case, it protrudes and is chafes as you walk, impossible to ignore, and would drive me nuts in any situation.  Other than that, the material is very stretchy, lightweight, and slimmer fitting than most other parachute-style convertible pants, hopefully they release a re-designed version sans-rough zipper seams. In the meantime, my search for the perfect convertible pants continues..."

Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"I was a little disappointed with this item. My cat loves her dart & she's an even bigger sucker for string; her last string arm toy she completely destroyed - she's not very gentle with her ""prey"", so I was delighted to see this string almost completely incased in a plastic compartment. Unfortunately the string doesn't move sporadically in the manner that the dart varies in speed & quickly changes direction. This toy goes one speed, one direction. Pretty boring & predictable, my cat just times the string then grabs it & drags the entire toy around the house with her as it struggles & whirs."

What was she really rebelling against, and if she was trying to prove something to herself and/or everyone else; why? This feels like a film that is missing crucial scenes, and throughout my viewing I kept expecting something, anything, that would underpin Lynda's desperate and self-destructive behaviour. While I did find the ending to be somewhat redeeming of Lynda's character, there just simply isn't enough plot or character development to push me over the hump to liking this film.

We haven't dropped it or done anything to it (even though I would expect a baby toy to be able to withstand drops). My toddler is sad that we won't let him play with it, but I've tried everything to make it work again and it won't.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I installed this thermostat on a single stage Water Furnace geothermal unit.  Despite a minor glitch in the beginning it has been running very well.  When I first installed it there was a firmware issue that shut my unit down and led to a very cold morning, but customer service was great and they updated the firmware over the phone.  I do wish the thermostat came with more technical details as I still had multiple questions that were not covered in the manual, once again customer service was great in answering them.  My goal in installing this unit was to eliminate my electric backup heat from kicking on in cold weather.  It has succeeded in doing this.  It can be -10 degrees out and my geothermal unit will not need the backup.  It does run longer but it is still more cost effective than paying for the electric heat.  I like how it learns how long it takes your house to heat up or cool down and then automatically adjusts the run times to have the house at the correct temperature by the time you want it.  Having a geothermal unit is a lot different than a regular heating system as it cannot handle large swings in temperature especially in heating mode.  I have my house set to 65 in the day and 63 at night / away.  That's about the biggest swing my geothermal unit can handle.  Even with this small swing in temperature I am noticing lower electric bills by about $30 a month.  I love the computer interface for programming it and the graphs that show you detailed usage reports and data."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"We did Christmas a week early with one side of the family, and this was literally the ONLY toy (besides paper and boxes) our VERY active 21-month-old played with at all, and he sat with it for at least half an hour in one sitting.  It took him several tries to figure out how to get the coins into the slots and get his fingers out of the way.  It would admittedly be easier if they were open slots to drop into instead of having to the circles that barely fit the coins, since clumsy toddler fingers make it a bit difficult, but he eventually figured it out.  He's a toddler, though, so he doesn't make it every time, and it sometimes frustrates him.

Some things you might not be able to see from the photos and description:
>The coin slot at the top drops the coins into the coin return on the left.  You can watch the coin slide down via a ""track"" in the back.
>The yellow display at the top is actually button that changes the ""display"" (it's just a roll with images on it) every time you press it.
>Once you stack up the coins in the register, you have to swipe a ""credit card"" through the slot on top of the drawer to make them all drop into the drawer.
>The lever opens the drawer and makes a ""cha-ching"" noise."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This toy is amazing - and is in no way for kids only!  It was intended for my youngest nephew who does in fact adore it and carries it around with him, but his older brothers who are both teenagers also couldn't stop for lack of a better word ""playing"" with it.  In fact, he had to fight them off for playing rights!  When I first received it, I unboxed it to make sure everything was alright and you do need to put on the sticker decals according to the diagram on the box, and I've got to say that even for me as an adult seeing what it all does so I could explain it to him was actually quite fun for me too.

The Millennium Falcon itself is much larger than I imagined, making it even cooler for kids, and it's fantastic that they also included a Hans, Chewie, and R2D2 figure rather than making you buy all the people separately (though there is plenty of room for extra figures from the movie to buy on your own for even more fun).  There's so much you can do inside the Millennium Falcon too.  There are trap doors, a Jedi training station, a movable ladder, seats for your figures, blasting rockets, and a cockpit you can open and close.  For the adults and teens it was just a tad disappointing that the cockpit only sits one so Hans and Chewbacca can't both sit in there together like in the movies, but the youngest didn't seem to mind at all.

This really is so much fun for the young and young at heart.  If you were a huge Star Wars fan back in the day this is a must to get for your kids - and that way you can play with it too!"

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This a brilliant, fun, thought provoking, wonderful book by a mistress of her craft.  I do not know if it is the best detective novel of all time, but it is up there. I would say it was one of the best novels I ever read - period. I read it many years ago, decades, in fact. I could do no more than give a general synopsis, though usually I don't bother when others have anyway. But, if you put a copy in my hand today, I would read it again. The fact that she was not aware of certain evidence or relied on evidence that we would now perhaps think not so persuasive is irrelevant. Most detective novels are far more unrealistic than this one, which is at least steeped in history. I read some of the negative comments, as I almost always do when I loved a book. Generally speaking, it gives the impression that some people who are uninterested or uninformed by history were bored by the book. But, note that over 80% of reviewers gave it 4 or more stars and over 90% 3 or more. That's pretty good. This is not a Reacher novel (and I like them) and the protagonist is bedridden, so don't expect action. It is a mental adventure and she succeeded wildly."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I was looking for some sturdy, good quality stainless pots and pans, but I couldn't afford the all-clads. I did a lot of research, and I came across this set. I even saw some of the pots on America's Test Kitchen saying that they were their top cheap choice for pots.

I knew that some people complained about discoloration when cooking, well, I found out that most stainless will discolor with normal use. I have indeed had my pots discolor if I do not clean them properly (chore-boy) or if I have cooked something for a really long time in them. In my experience, I learned that if there is anything stuck to the pans, boil water in them and it will take off just about anything. Also, if they do discolor, that will usually go away after I use them again.

As far as the whole eggs stick thing, yes they will. You have to lower your stove temp considerably to cook delicate things as the aluminum core really heats up well. Also, learn how to cook in stainless. That means look it up on the net etc until you are used to them. It takes some time and some burnt food in the meantime until you get the hang of it, especially coming from non-stick. Also, butter isn't the best for keeping food from sticking. Smart balance or pam works the best.

Really, I have been able to cook some great things that I couldn't cook easily with my old set. First of all, these can go into the oven and the dishwasher, two benefits over my old set. Also, I get a much better browning on meats and other foods with this set.

Overall, I really like this set a lot. I would eventually like all-clad, but for less than the cost of a single pan, I got the whole set of Cuisinart. I think it worked out well."

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"For 6 month it worked quite well. Leaks after a little over a year, and is difficult to clean thoroughly. Also, it's impossible to find replacement charcoal filters that fit. I'm shopping for something with a different design.

After posting the above, I've thoroughly cleaned it, including the pump. Now it works fine. So I'm changing it to 4 stars. The reason it's still not 5 stars is the difficulty getting filters that fit properly. I had to use a spring to wedge it against one side in order to properly seal it. Otherwise the filter is just soaking in the water and not filtering anything."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I've always wanted a rowing machine to add to my basement gym so bought this one.  It was easy to assemble (not a lot to assemble, just a couple pieces).  It has differenct settings and found I needed to use it a few times to find the right tension to start with.  Must admit it kicked my butt at the higher tension so had to back it down a bit.  The only problem that I encountered was the left chainguard was broken during shipping.  I contacted the company as instructed by the enclosed manual and was told they would get a replacement part out to me. (The book states they have 180 days to respond so I'll have to wait and see but I did receive good customer service). Would recommend it to the 'at home gym' person who wants to add something different to their workout equipment.  Great buy (just waiting on the replacement part)."

The extra length gets whatever dripping 6 inches away from the control handles and tub spout! The ""Waterhill"" (goose neck) actually helps with prompt turn-off of water, and related ""after-drips"" which used to occur.

I can dry my whole body off and the towel will still be dry enough for me to use it to put my hair up in a turban. This NEVER happened with my traditional cotton towels, which is why I always had to buy, wash, and tote around two towels (not to mention that they never dried fast enough and got to stinking in humid weather). Now I can get dry just as fast (if not faster) with just one towel! It folds down to almost nothing and dries overnight. It's also very soft. So basically, I am in love with this little bit of microfiber. :) I use it every time I bathe, and also to dry my hair when I get out of the pool. It really is the greatest!"
Books_5,5.0,OR,"I have no doubt that if I had no life outside of reading, I would've finished this book in a day. With my schedule, it took 4 days, and I truly enjoyed it!  You have to love a book that leaves you smiling as you read the last lines of the book and then sends you to the internet immediately to buy book 2. Charley Davidson is a ""grim reaper"", but not in the traditional sense that we all know. She is a portal through which those who didn't immediately cross over can use to get where they're supposed to go - presumably Heaven. The dead see her as this bright light, which they are usually drawn to, and she sometimes has to help them with their unfinished business before they are ready to cross over. She is also a very witty, sarcastic Private Investigator, and she's very good at it, with the help that she receives from some of the dearly departed. Oh, and there's this supernatural being that comes to her in the night in her dreams and has his way with her, and she's pretty happy about it. While I'm not one who is drawn to those lusty, cliche romance novels, I do love paranormal fiction and suspense, so this book fit the bill. Add to that, Charley's sarcastic sense of humor, which I am all over, and this made for a very quick, enjoyable read. The book is peppered throughout with little sarcastic one-liners, some of which had me laughing out loud and feeling silly, since my family had no idea what was so funny. Some reviewers commented that they were excessive, and maybe so, but not to the point where it might have taken away from my enjoyment of the book. If you have similar tastes, I highly recommend this book. If you're a bit on the prudish side, maybe not so much."

My son has found it a good mix of humor, fun and some great cards to play with. I like that it does not require any assistance from the kids. My son has had a lot of fun playing with this, but I have no doubt he will enjoy it in the long run. My son is a big fan of Thomas the Train. He plays this game every day. He plays this game at least once a week. It's really fun for the whole family. The game is easy to learn, and I like that there is a lot of replay value. It's not like a game of chess, where you have to win every game and then lose. It's more like a game of musical chairs, with a whole host of rules. It's a great game for a family, and a good way to learn how to count numbers and numbers."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"I bought this for using as a hydration pouch but decided that in that purpose, it was far inferior to the Camelbak Antidote. The zip opening and closure is not as secure as I would like the opening of a big bag of water to be inside a pack while moving around. It's also kind of awkward to fill from a spigot, sink faucet or bottle. The drink port is a bit awkward to use as well but its fine I guess. The bag itself seems sturdy enough and not likely to crack or puncture easily.

However, after setting it aside as a hydration bag, I decided to use this as a component in a gravity water filter, (one that I cobbled together with some extra tubing and fittings and the Sawyer Mini filter, but imitating the Platypus Gravity Works) specifically as the dirty water bag. The big zip top makes filling the bag from a natural source like a river or stream extremely easy and the handle thing on top with some paracord or long Nite Ize gear ties makes it easy to hang the bladder from a tree. For that purpose I give it 4 stars, only wishing that it was bigger than 3L to filter water for more than 1 person at a time at stops or in camp."

Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold Vosloo, Patricia Velasquez, and (even) The Rock have given fine performances. The special effects may be a bit too over-the-top but it's still marvelous to look at. Fast pace, fast adventures, and a different music score (this time it's Alan Silvestri and not Jerry Goldsmith) give feast for the eyes and ears. Watch this movie.

It's the U.S. versus Russia during the Cold War and you can feel the tension as each side tries to control countries around the world. You get to live through most of the major events of that time period because they are actually played out in the game.

I'm not sure the word ""fun"" would best describe this game - you are certainly not laughing your way to victory with a wacky group of friends. But if your idea of ""fun"" is deep strategy, constant awareness of how each new event changes the world's politics- and therefore your alliance and chance of winning, and tough decision making, then you will LOVE this game!
I would say the learning curve is moderate as there are a lot of things to keep track of, but once you get a few plays in, things are smooth sailing.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"There is little doubt that Trevor is a master of his craft and perhaps the  greatest living short story writer in the world today.  After Rain, a  volume of twelve stories, explores such subjects as infidelity,  homosexuality, religious conflicts, and violence.  What makes these stories  so powerful, however, is not the subjects they deal with, but the portrayal  of the characters thoughts, emotions, and responses.  Trevor is able to  examine such human conditions as jealousy, rage, sadness, regret, and hope  in a non-judgmental light that leaves the reader looking into oneself to  gain further insight.  His writing style is nothing short of remarkable.  He is eloquent and simplistic, never revealing more than he should, making  the unspoken a compelling component of his story.  If you have not yet read  Trevor, I urge you to wait no longer.  His literary grace will surely leave  a lasting impact on you as a reader and as a human being."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"For many years now, I've been a fan of the true crime genre; reading nothing but these nonfiction tales of the worst side of mankind. After a while, while still interested in the crimes, the forensics, and the inner workings of the justice system, a reader can easily reach a point where the crime in and of itself has no shock value.

That was not the case in my most recently read book: Pure Murder by Corey Mitchell.

In Pure Murder, Mitchell tells the gut-wrenching, absolutely sickening tale surrounding the deaths of two Houston, Texas teenager girls: Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Pena.

On what should have been a short walk home through on of Houston's city parks, these young girls had the bad fortune of meeting up with six of Texas' teenage lowlifes: Efrain Perez, Raul Villarreal, Peter Cantu, Joe Medellin, Venancio ""Yuni"" Medellin, Jr., and Sean O'Brien.

Simply because the young, innocent girls were in the wrong place at the wrong time when these scumbags were ""feeling their oats,"" they were tortured, raped, and murdered.

For the first time in a while, this true crime piece managed to enrage me as I could not hardly fantom that in a group of six people there was not one decent individual that could have, in some way, helped these young victims.

And, as an added bonus, especially in a time where illegal immigration is such a hot topic, the attempts by Joe Medellin to use his illegal immigrant status as a means to absolve the indictment against him was, to say the least, infuriating. He participates in the raping, mutilating and murder of two young girls and he expects that this country will allow him freedom on a technicality?! I could not even begin to understand the audacity of this pathetic, spineless child killer.

If you're up for a good read that evokes so many emotions you feel as though you are on an emotional rollercoaster, look no further than this newest release from Corey Mitchell."

It doesn't lock down in the miter slot, but there is plenty of friction to keep it in place.  Combined with my digital caliper, this is a great solution for squaring table saw blades and fences, and aligning riving knives.  I've also used it with the miter slot on my router table for precise micro-adjustments."

I just take off the key chain part and stick it in my pocket anytime I going to buy stuff that needs to measured... like when I go to Lowes.  I'd definitely buy this again.  Actually, I did.. bought about 8 of them and keep them around the house and garage."

I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a good pair of earbuds for the money.I bought this for a friend, but he does not like it.  I just bought a second one, and he is very happy with it.  I can't say enough about it, and I like it.  I also like it for the price.  It's very comfortable and I can't believe how much the battery life is!  I have a Sony A6300 and it was very hard to get a charger from my local electronics store.

Overall, a great unpowered hub - if you want to charge multiple devices at once, get something powered instead, but this delivers what's promised."

I am very happy with these sights.I love these socks! They are comfortable and easy to wear. I use them everyday for cycling, camping, hiking, and hiking. I am a big fan of these socks.

I am 6'2"" and the size 6 fit my head. I would recommend these socks for anyone.I love this bike seat. It's small and easy to use. I have it mounted on my front end, and it's very comfortable to ride. The seat itself is a bit on the stiff side, but it's not a problem. It's also easy to install and adjust. The seat is a little big for me, but it's a lot of room for storage. I ride a Honda Civic with a seatpost for my bike, and it's a little too large for my bike. It's not a big deal, but I'm not a big fan of the seatpost at all. I think I would have preferred to"

I just finished the most glorious story of love, adventure, unsurpassed sensuality, honor and devotion that you could ever wish to read.  Set in old California during the difficult and often violent transition from Spanish to American control the love story of Ramon and Caralee is spellbinding.  I almost cried when it ended.

The foot bed is too long, the heel is too wide, yet the crossing straps are too tight. I am in the process of returning them."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"One of my favorite baseball movies ever, and (if Wikipedia can be believed) closer to real life than many other 'based on a true story' flicks.  Inspirational, with a solid performance from Quaid and the supporting cast also does a great job.  Would rent it again, and recommend watching with younger kids who still think that baseball and their Dads are great."

Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,CG,"So I've somewhat accepted the premise of the game, but I'm not happy with the way the cards are so small. The cards are solid and clear, and the game is very educational.

The cards are in good shape, and the board is very compact. There are no cards that get lost in the game, and I'm not sure if it would be so bad if it did. It does make it fun for my 8 year old, but I feel like it's not worth the price of admission.

Overall, I'm happy with this purchase. I'm looking forward to playing it more often, and I'll be keeping it for my grandkids"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"As noted by other reviewers, this is the only one I've tried that is not a mesh one. I had to replace the mesh one with the mesh one because it is so thick. The mesh one is a thin, thick fabric. I don't know how long the mesh one will last but I guess it will be about a year or so. The mesh one is quite thick and I like the fact that it is so easy to clean and dry. I haven't tried the mesh one yet but I will update this review as soon as it's ready. If you have questions, please ask."

I love it. I have a German Shepherd and a Shih Tzu. I've had this for about a year now and I love the fact that they don't have to worry about the front part of the collar getting loose. The collar has a really nice reflective ring on the front which makes it shine a bit more. I like that it's a little thicker than my other harnesses which is good because I have a dog that is a lot lighter than I am. It's also a little heavier. I wish it had a little more padding on the front part.

My cats love this collar. It's not a heavy duty collar and it's easy to put on and off. My dog is about 20 lbs and weighs about 18 pounds. I think it's a good quality collar. I have two older cats and they all play tug of war with this collar. They have never had any problems with it. I don't have to worry about them pulling at it. I just use a"

Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"Very confused about why I ordered two of these from the same seller but at different times (a few weeks apart) and one is made in Canada and one is made in China? Is one a fake, or did they suddenly move production to one country or another? And which country are they currently being produced in. Must say I am disappointed that  there is a discrepancy like this. Both belts are ok though so far functionality wise, but I am keeping my eyes out."
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,CG,This is a cute variation on a classic story.  I really enjoyed this story.  The characters were so well developed and the story was entertaining.  I think this is a great book to read.  It will keep you interested from beginning to end.I enjoyed the series

Electronics_5,5.0,CG,"I ordered the Blackberry minikeyboard (Cisco) and it works great.  The only thing that is a little off is the plastic part.  The plastic part is a bit difficult to get to and it's not in the way.  I wish it was a little thicker but that would be a problem.

I did get a free shipping label on the Minikeyboard but I was not expecting much.  I am not sure if I will get another one for my phone or if I will get a return label.  I will update this review as time goes on.

Pros:
-Easy to use
-Not too big
-No noise
-Small size
-No shipping label

Cons:
-There is a plastic part on the bottom.  It's not the part that is the issue but I would expect it to be.
-The battery cover is a bit flimsy.  It doesn't stay in place well.  It's about the size of a small bottle of water.  I guess it would be more than I would like for a laptop.
-The remote is very easy to use.  I don't have any trouble using it.

Overall, I think it"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Love it! Worth ever penny. FYI: it's a driver not a drill.
Books_5,2.0,OR,"I read Veritas after reading Hostile Witness and found the author using the same old plot devices that seemed novel in the first - letters/statements from characters that explained complicated plot antecedents.
While a lot of the dialogue is quite good, much is long declamatory prose that explicates the character or the plot. The intricacies of the relationships and the exaggerations of plot elements became unbelievable and sort of silly in what was meant to be a realistic novel. It just got sort of boring - I finished it but didn't care."
Toys_and_Games_5,2.0,OR,I thought for the price that I was getting a large full sheeted booklet of stickers. It's not an 81/2 by 11 book. It's more like 4x6.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,This is a great cooker. It is making me fatter. Easy to clean and lighter than traditional crock pots.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Book 1 has many layers that I enjoyed figuring out as I read! Many authors are predictable, not Ms. Strauss. Marlow (Mars) is a shy, geek that does not do well in social gatherings so starts up a conversation with a shy, socially awkward girl named Teagan through a chat room. This is where the adventure begins. Too many spoilers would be revealed if I expounded further. Let me just say that you will be surprised with each turn of the page! Book 1 could and can stand on its own, but again,. I want to read more about the characters I met in this book!
Book 2 in the series, kept me on my toes and up at night as I tried to figure out who done/or was doing it! The mystery was profound up until the last chapter!
Hickory Dickory Dock is the third in the series! I really enjoyed the story. It can stand alone but reading the first two will add to the enjoyment and mystery! Marlow and Sage have a connection; and not in the way that you would think! The mystery is woven through out the whole book! Who done it or who is doing it! Marlow and Sage must solve the mystery to survive! I think this book will appeal to all audiences, young and old(well, anyone that enjoys a little sci-fi and mystery). Great job Ms."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This was a very captivating and enjoyable novel.  Young takes us back to Old Town and Haymakers for one exciting and emotionally provocative tale.  Her vivid descriptions and down to earth storytelling transported me to Jersey alongside the characters.

Youngs writing style makes you feel like you're sitting beside the characters listening to the story instead of reading it.  This up close and personal approach really drew me in until I couldn't put the book down.  I really, really enjoyed getting to know Harley better.  Weve met her throughout the series but getting up close and personal with her makes it so much more real.  I feel like I understand Harley now.  Seeing what she thinks and learning her history makes her more real, rather than just the catty girl weve come to know.  Getting a glimpse into Jakes mind is also quite revealing.  I may think his rationale is completely skewed but I understand (and like) him so much better now.  The contrast between the way the two main characters see themselves as compared to how they see each other definitely adds to the story.

As a whole, this was a fantastic novel that wrapped up this series nicely.  Im definitely sad to have hit the end of the Wilde brothers saga, but it was a fantastic journey while it lasted.

Please note that I received a complimentary copy of this work in exchange for an honest review."

Also, he doesn't see ""Nightmare in my Closet"", but he WILL when the right time comes.  The whole thing is extremely well done.

It's a little thin, but it's not heavy.  The only thing I don't like is the fact that it's not a micro-USB port, which is a nice feature.  Other than that, it's a nice little drive.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this drive.  It's a solid drive, and it's solid.  It's a nice little drive.I bought this because it has the right size for my tablet and I like the color and the fact that it has a USB charging port. It's not for everyone, but for those who don't have an external charger, this is a good option.

I don't recommend this to anyone who wants to use a USB charging port on their tablet, but for those who do, this is a great option.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This is the first time I have worn a pair of compression socks that are not made by another 3 letter brand that I liked. I am very leery because other socks have lacked the compression quality. These socks fit very snugly. They have a surprisingly good feel on the ankles and achilles tendon and it doesn't matter how much you move around they will stay in place and not have to pulled back up. Which is what you need from a compression sock, 1. Great compression, 2. Comfort, 3. Stay in place and these socks check all of those boxes."

However, the biggest negative for me, and one of the reasons I don't use it much, is because it tangles up so easily. The reflective tape they have woven into the rope makes it tangle even easier than it normally would without the reflective material. But for $12, I'm not going to complain too much."

Although EVO is excellent bang for the buck, and both smoke any disc drive; this is the near future for state of the art storage that still retains an impeccable reliability value. Samsung is the #1 player is both of these considerations for fixed memory technology, and once you choose SSD, there's no reason to risk performance security and longevity by saving 30% on the older SSD technology of the EVO. The 10 year warranty says it all."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I've enjoyed this series, and believe we may have to face a TWO state solution ourselves in the VERY near future.  As pointed out throughout the 5 books, freedom loving people cannot coexist with nanny state leftist progressives.  Civil war in our modern age would be beyond intolerable, and both sides know we will never change the others mind.  This leaves us with one solution to our political problem: A Free State America and a Progressive Union America.  We as a people can then ""vote with our feet"" as to which side best represents our hopes and dreams.

Spoiler about the end of book 5:

While it has a feel good ending where a bankrupt and disillusioned LSA rejoins the USA and it mostly works out, I do not believe a reintegration  of millions of indoctrinated leftists would be possible without destroying the free society."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,CG,"One Con that's acceptable enough, and not too bad, is that it's a little hard to put on.  I had to replace a couple of the plastic plastic strips to get it to work properly.  It's not a huge deal, but it is very annoying to put on.  I don't think I'll be able to use it for much longer than a day of riding.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, compact bike that won't require much to do.

The other issue I have with this bike is that it's not a very big thing.  I have a 5 footer and it's only about 10 inches wide.  I had to buy two larger bikes, but I don't think I can find a large bike with a 5 footer.  I have a 5 footer with a lot of space in it, and it was too big for me.  I will probably get a shorter bike for the money.  I'll just go with the larger bikes.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a compact bike that won't require much to do.

I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a more compact bike.  It's a nice bike, but it's not a great one.  It will work fine for me, but I wouldn't recommend it.

Brielle, Chelle and Meachy all found themselves caught up but I wasn't expecting the secrets that came about. Blake was just trifling and doing the most. Here I thought he was messing up one situation but so much more came with it. Brielle was wrong but it was nothing she could do to change the way things panned out. I liked Brandon and his boldness at dinner and that really had me cracking up. I was pissed about the lie he told at his office but I guess he was doing what he thought was best. Eliana seemed like a very sweet person and I hate how what she thought was something special was built from lies. Chelle and Meachy had me so confused but once I started understanding what was what it really threw me for a loop. Meachy's role wasn't excused but she didn't have to let everybody else's secrets out to save her own ass. I'll admit I had a wtf look once Chelle found out Brielle's secret because I was thinking how in the world can she be mad when she's no better. Monique was bitter and wanted her cake and eat it too. Her response to KJ let me know she didn't have it all. Once the secrets started flowing it was like they'd never end. So much trust was broken but the very secrets that destroyed so much also had some good to come about. As always great job Toni and I can't wait to see what you come out with next."

Not only do we get to watch a beautiful relationship develop but we also get to see the action and suspense with everyone trying to figure out and stop the killings. It was nice to see the other characters from past books and seeing how everyone interacts with one another.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,CG,"My Kitchen Aid went south, and it was time to try something else.

The first one we bought was the Eureka, which is the cheaper model, but it is much better quality.

The second one we bought was the Nordic, which is the cheaper version.

We used it with a German Shepherd, which is the more expensive version.

The Nordic is just as good as the Eureka, but it is much better quality, so if you want to make your own Eureka, you'll want to try it with the Nordic.

The Nordic is a little more expensive, but it is the best quality that we've had, and we like it.

The Nordic is made in the USA, so it has a good quality, but it is not the best quality as the Nordic is made in China.

The Nordic is very well made, and the quality of the Nordic is good, but the quality of the Nordic is very poor.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This standalone conclusion to the Norseton Wolves series is one of my favorites. Holley Trent has a gift of getting inside her character's heads and succinctly communicating their emotions, fears, hopes and desires to the reader. I don't know of any other author who can lay a character open with such understanding and yet do it with humor and compassion.  She is one of my top five authors, in part for that reason. I highly recommend this book and the series, which can standalone individually, as well as from it's companion Afotama Legacy series.

Arnold has only been in Norseton a few days when he has a vision that takes him to the Roosevelt Forest in Colorado. He has seen a she wolf and her baby and all he knows about them is that the goddess wants him there to meet them. When he arrives, he sees the woman shift into her wolf form, leaving the infant unprotected.
Leonora was recently bitten by her mate and is forced to shift with the full moon, requiring her to leave Kinzey alone in the forest. She's on the run from a culture that denigrates women and an abusive relationship where she is seen as a possession rather than a person. She made her decision to run and having no support system is a consequence of that choice. But she has very strong protective instincts for her daughter and when she returns to her human form to find a strange alpha male wolf shifter cuddling an unusually calm Kinzey, she's enraged. He refuses to hand Kinzey over, though, and she soon finds they are headed to Arizona, to a pack he says is different. How can she believe him, when what he says goes against everything she's ever experienced?  Especially when he bites her while they are in wolf form and neither of them remember anything from that run. He promised her she would have choices at Norseton. But  the first thing he did was to take them away.

Books_5,1.0,OR,"I didn't like this book and I didn't like Sally Mann.  It was the most boring book I have read in a long time.  First of all, she really puts a great emphases on how smart she supposedly is.  She includes notes from elementary, high school and college teachers.  Pardon me while I yawn.

  This book is interspersed with photos, copies of notes and letters, and anything Mann throws in to make herself look good.  Her notoriety comes from the nude photos she took of her children growing up.  Many people found them sexually suggestive.  I found them exploitive but not really offensive.  Mann spends time defending herself on the photos calling herself nave time and time again.  That's OK for awhile but it gets tiresome when she doesn't smarten up at all.  She is shocked that pedophiles are interested in them. Really?

  She also separates the pictures from the children.  She says the children are merely actors in the pictures and can keep the two separate identities apart even the 6 year old. Then she goes on to say how nice it is to have pictures of their childhood.  Which is it?  Are they separate or true depictions?

  After that she goes on to explore past relations.  She discusses her husband's parents murder/suicide.  Then she goes on to discuss kinfolk in even the more distant past.  This is when I lost complete interest and just thumbed through the rest of the book's pictures.  By then I was so turned off that I didn't even enjoy them.

  This was definitely not the book for me."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I have owned one of these for some time and recently got a new one for a second computer.  It's a great quality keyboard that lacks a lot of the new fangled style and shape, (thank God) of other keyboards that cost so much more and are at times far from the coolest thing around.  I'm speaking of the so called wrap around keyboards that supposedly are more realistically or comfortably designed for our hands.  Sometimes even certain keys are bigger or curled around or something or other.  My experience with them are that most have been far from the ""better mousetrap"" to be sure.  I have wavered in the past from the basic, classic idea that this keyboard is, but not anymore.  Not only has Amazon gotten it dead on with this baby, but they have also managed to improve it a little without messing up the works.  The letters on my old keyboard are not fading at all, (something that always happens on cheap keyboards with the letters used most often), but they have also separated the keys nicely so that its easy to clean and not hit two keys at once when you have fat fingers like me.  Also, this keyboard has a slight built in elevation in the back that is a better quality than the little tabs that other keyboards have that are are often flimsier.  And lastly this keyboard stays put very well with good solid feet to prevent you chasing it around your desk while working.  The only thing about this keyboard that I personally had a problem with is its USB plug.  My computer is so old it still has the rounded plug in the rear for a keyboard.  Fortunately adapters for such old time 'puters are easy to be found and I had one already.  In conclusion, if you believe in sometimes, (make that often) older or classic being better, I highly recommend this Amazon basic. Its very reasonably priced and top quality for the dollar..."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"I agree with Vosper's ideas. They are incredibly radical, and yet, at this point in my spiritual journey, they make clear and logical sense. I feel saddened by the vitriol that can result from anyone either agreeing or disagreeing with these ideas. Although I have left theism behind, it has not been without struggle or deep sadness. My former beliefs gave me so much comfort and joy, and a sense of purpose, all of which have now been torn from me. Therefore, I don't condemn or rail against those who still cling to them fiercely. I understand their anger against these ideas - an anger born of fear bordering on panic. And I don't want to be so smugly certain I am right now, as I was so smugly certain I was right when I was a fundamentalist literalist Christian. I have gained much, but may have lost even more. I think the church must move in this direction, but it pains me to say so."

If you have a hand-held switch, you will probably have to do it by hand, because it will feel very awkward.  I have tried other types of hand-held switches, but these are the first ones I have tried and I am very happy with the result.

I would not recommend this to anyone unless you are going to have a very tight grip on the levers and switches.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,I bought these boots for my girlfriend and she was very excited to receive such a lovely gift. She loves that they go on so easily and yet they are incredibly secure once they are laced up. They come in a variety of colors but the blue color we chose is a lovely pairing with any type of denim. They are made fairly well and have held up great so far in their use. The pocket on the boots is great too since it provides a place to stash money or a small set of keys when you don't want to or can't put them elsewhere. She states that they are quite comfortable but despite this she still chose to put a set of cushioning insoles in them. She does this with all of her shoes and boots though. She had worn them for the better part of eight hours and was happy with how great her feet felt despite being active for so long. My girlfriend certainly didn't need another set of boots but these ones are worth having. I think they look great on her and she is quite happy with how they look and feel on herself as well.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and fair review of the item and I have found myself to be very happy with my purchase.

Of course, they're useful only for bolts that are within reach, where you have plenty of room to rotate the wrench around the bolt head.

I really like that the tools themselves are very heavy and seem durable, but I'll update my review after I've used them for a while.

As another reviewer mentioned, this set ""...doesn't just replace 8 standard wrench sizes but also covers 6 fastener types, hex, square, 12pt, external torx, partially rounded hex and spline.""  Quite an impressive list.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I loved this short story, but I wish it had been longer.  It had the makings of the beginning of a full novel.  I won't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that.  If you liked the previous full novels in the series, I say you should read this short story for completeness if nothing else.  It is really worth the read because it seems to give details that will probably matter later in the series.  Have at it because I don't think you'll be disappointed.  The characters are good as always.  I already started the next book at the time I am typing this review because this story was so short."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I wanted to try this vacuum out in my home and I find it okay but nothing to brag about. Suction appears good and it picked up everything we threw at it, including pet hair, sand, dirt and dust just fine.  This is my first ""swerve"" type vaccum so it took me a few days to understand how to make it go where I wanted it to go.  I also liked the fact it has a HEPA filter to prevent dust from escaping from the unit back into the room. It also comes with a very long cord, and the dirt canister or cup empties from the bottom into the trash, which seems to lead to less dust getting back into the air for us.  But there are some drawbacks.  There is no headlight or height adjustment feature and this unit is difficult to push over carpets. Clean any good size room with carpets and you will feel as if you have been at the gym doing push ups.  The unit does a great job on hardwood and tile floors however and I would certainly recommend it for that.  This unit is also relatively quiet compared to my other vacumms.  You can use it without waking up everybody in the house and I like that.  You can also detach the unit from its base and carry it to clean stairs, etc.  This is not a good unit to try and clean small area rugs however as the suction is too great and it simply picks up the rug.  The handle of the unit can be adjusted up or down to fit your desire and also lifts out.  When you lift out the handle, attach the hose to it and the provided attachment, you can use it to clean higher up areas like drapes or window sills."

Panasonic customer service will not assist in any way to remedy the situation and they won't even give me the contact info for an authorized repair place.

Lifespan of the batteries in the number pad (it's been dead for a while, but the keyboard is still operating on the same batteries that came with it). Doesn't fit in a keyboard tray correctly.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I want all of the guinea pig world to know these EZ whelp pads are awesome. This is so much better than fleece and totally cost effective. I have a large rabbit cage which is 17x40 and my piggies sleep in this at night and spend all day in a kiddie play pool with a fence around it...3 ft round. I was using carefresh bedding and  a litter box which my boars use about half the time for pee and some poo. The carefresh is odor absorbing but definitely dusty....then along comes whelping pads. WOW!!! I BOUGHT A 36 inch pad and put that in the bottom of the kiddie pool. Its soft and wonderful for piggie feet and I only need to take a little plastic sand shocel and scoop up any poops and place in the litter box. Pee is immediately absorbed and after a week still no smell.
I washed the pad in the washing machine on cold and dried on low heat, cones out like new. So I then got the slightly thicker paw print pads as poctured and one pad fits in the travel cage I have and 2 pads fit in their night home cage.
I just use my toy shovel each morning and its great. I was able to get carefresh bedding on sale so I use that only in the litter box.
Persobally these make the cages look neat and fresh and I think its better to not have as much paper bedding. Its cheaper than fleece and I think more absorbing.
Thanks to EZ whelp...piggies have a great new source for their home needs. Pics are of bog cage, travel cage, pig pool...and one of my boars."

I'm pretty blown away by this little beast because a) it flies really smoothly and is relatively easy to control, even for a beginner like me. and b) it takes a lickin and keeps on ticking! I've been flying this thing for about a week non-stop now with at least 3-4 total hours of flight time logged so far. (It only gets 5-7 minutes per charge so I've flown it like at least 30 times already) And I have crashed it way over 100 times already. And it has never sustained real damage. 4 stars not 5 because the props do come off REALLY easily and are easily lost. I put a tiny drop of glue on each prop and that has helped a lot. I also tried the Hobbyzone Faze (which looks very similar and has the exact same controller) - but looks are deceiving - this Estes thing blows the Faze out of the sky! The Faze was harder to control, and the Faze died within the first few flights. Meanwhile the Estes keeps on buzzing and delighting us. Yay, Estes! Love this thing!"

Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"Everlasting Fun Treat Ball / B0009YD8NS

I have several treat dispensing toys for my puppy, and I like this one the least. The design is very poor, in my opinion, at least compared to other treat toys we've used. To begin with, it is difficult to ""load"" the toy with food and treats because there are two identical loading holes, one opposite the other. This means that when I pour treats in, they pour right out on the opposite side. It's like filling a bucket with no bottom, and it's very frustrating. Eventually, you have to just find the biggest treats you can, and jam them in, which is a pain and a half. Not to mention the edges of the hole catch and grab at your fingers - fun!

That brings me to my next point - you cannot put small treats or puppy kibble in here as they will fall out immediately. Only big fat treats will provide the dog a challenge, but fortunately the makers of this product make such treats and are more than willing to sell them to you. Which is fine, I guess, and I went ahead and bought some, but I prefer to fill my treat toys with at least some regular kibble so that the puppy doesn't just gorge himself on a bunch of rich treats all at once. Since this ball won't allow me to do this, it's now an occasional toy, not a reliable daily toy. Bottom line: I feel that this toy is difficult to fill, and can only be used for ""treat gorging"" and not for regular dinner time. If your fingers are less delicate than mine and you just want a treat ball, you may like this - my dog certainly likes the chewy rubber and he hasn't destroyed it yet (although he's not much of a chewer). However, if you want an easy to fill ball that can hold kibble and enliven dinner time, I recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Omega-Paw-Tricky-Treat-Ball/dp/B0002DK26M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball</a>."

Everything was just toooooo contrived, from the CIA head, to the Carnivore, to the look-alike cousins, to the clown disguises, to the evil doctor.  For me, this was not a ""page-turner"" and I only finished it because it was loaned to me by my best friend and I had to find out how Lynds wrapped this all together in the final outcome.  Unfortunately, the ending was also lame.  I believe Gayle will get better with practice and I would recommend this as a good airplane or waiting room read if you want something glitzy that doesn't take much power of concentration."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Dell laptops are not as evil as the 3 lower comments make them seem.  It takes some basic user knowledge to get accustomed with the product.  There is no need to 'knock' Dell down because of a bad user experience.

Blue screens are usually caused by bad programming or writing of software.  Blue screens have codes that say ""error: xxx""  where XXX is the name and code of the problem.  MOST bluescreens are MEMORY PARITY problems -- bad programming of software.

Dell not responding to customer issues is absurd.  I have never had that experience in the 15 years I've been contacting Dell for any situation.

My suggestion to people who have ""so much trouble"" is to figure out why others do not.  You may not realize that installing and uninstalling through the Windows installer is the proper way to install.  Installing through each individual programs installer is WRONG.  This advice will fix 9% of problems out there dealing with ""my laptop is slow now!"""
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"Well, I've been using it for quite sometime now and I honestly don't like it very much.

The fact that I've actually bought two sets of these makes it even worse. I'll keep the review short and simple.

Pros:
1. Easy to install and use
2. Buttons light up, can turn the feature on or off

Cons:
1. Buttons lights up and off too quickly, lights do not stay long enough
2. Distance for radio signal is poor, it's best not to have interference or obstacles in front or in between the signal path
3. The mouse wheel is infrared sensor, which kind of works but not as well as a mouse wheel. It's not as precise and you almost always lose track
4. Due to poor signals, I would constantly have to type something on TV and look at the pad, then look at the TV again to make sure the signal took the input, because sometimes it would not.

Also the lack of optical zoom means you are essentially buying a 35 mm point and shoot, so great if that's what you want (and u r willing to spend $10/week on batteries for regular ""vacation"" usage). IF you want greater flexibility, and something u won't grow out of or tired of real fast, u should keep looking for something that may involve extra initially, but you will get more use of.

In short, great price, but serious shortfalls w. respect to battery life and camera capabilities. Also, the cycle time between shots (especially when using flash) is painfully sloooooooow."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Here's a film where Seagal doesn't just go through those regular paces we all love him for, which is probably why most of the viewers reviewing this film here are disappointed.  I wasn't disappointed at all, and next to Under Siege, this is my favorite Seagal movie.  Not just because of the beautiful scenery, not just because Seagal plays a doctor who cares more about helping his patients get well than he does getting paid, not just because he gives both the government officials and the militia-extremists a real piece of his mind. Not even because of the role that Native American traditions and healing methods play in this film.

Maybe for all those things.  Or maybe because this take-no-prisoners 'tough guy' is a fine role model of a terrific father to his daughter in this film. It's a real treat to see this side of Seagal and it adds a dimension to his character that makes this more than just an action movie.

Meanwhile, there are plenty of enemies to defeat here, and Seagal defeats them all -- including the 'invisible enemy' of biochemical disease.  Not bad, not bad at all.  Better than good in fact.

My current house is smaller than our old one, so we had to go from 5 litter boxes to 3 boxes with clumping litter. I decided to change to this system in an attempt to be cleaner overall. Because of the 6 cats to 3 boxes, I do notice a particular odor from the urine. The cats are all spayed females. I think because this is new to me, I let the pad stay too long, and I was also used to using a litter additive to counteract odor. There is of course no tracked litter all over the floor, which is great, and it is very easy to clean. None of the cats have shown any problem with the change, (I did one box at a time). I now just need to figure out which pads need changing when, based on how many cats use a particular box to urinate in. So I believe it is simply an adjustment phase. I have a feeling I will be changing these pads every couple of days, but as I said, we have 3 boxes for 6 cats. Overall I am happy with this system. I did notice that the Japanese have the same product offered with a dome cover, which would be nice. This system makes the most sense of any I have seen so far."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Considering all the tools in my garage, this planer and the Dewalt 12"" sliding compound miter are the best investments I have made.  The only thing I am going to change is to put a spiral cutterhead in it.  If you have the wood bug hobby, this is THE planer to buy, short of a commercial machine.  I purchased this from Amazon on Jan 26, and it was delivered on Jan 30.  This is a good compromise of size and cutting capacity for a home or garage workshop.  I bought a dust collection adaptor to fit this to my shop vac, even though it says not to.  It fills up my shop vac pretty quickly, but it works.  I use very small increments of wood removal, and am able to get wood planed down to a perfect .500"" when measured with a dial caliper.  For fitting into 1/2"" cut dados, I couldn't be happier.  I've been using this on top of the table saw for a flat level surface, until I can make a sturdy wooden stand for it.  There are aftermarket carbide blades from Infiniti tools if you prefer not to double the value of the machine by buying a spiral cutterhead."

The first book in the series was the prequel, Prequel 2, and I'm a fan. The story was well told and the characters were well developed. I love how the author wrote the descriptions of the characters. I liked the fact that they were all over the place. There was also the fact that the author had to use a lot of language. It was like a well written story.

I liked the fact that the author used a lot of words and it made the story more realistic. I think that the author would have used some of the things that could have been used for a different story.

I liked the fact that the author kept the main character's name and family name. I also liked that the author used a lot of slang.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"THE SOLOIST is a fine novel, interweaving three stories that all center on the narrator: the rise and fall of a child prodigy cellist, the sole member of a jury at a murder trial who finds meaning in a defendent's case, and a teacher of a budding, gifted young Korean cellist.  Each story has its own cast of characters beautifully realized, but most important - each aspect of this tripartite novel is told with such informed authority that imagining the author in anything but an autobiographical mode is next to impossible.  Just as in his previous novel LYING AWAKE which dealt with  the inner thoughts of a cloistered nun, Salzman here shows us he has a thorough understanding of music, music making, and the sociology and philosophy of our court system and our education system.  Not that he stops at reportage. Hardly!  It is simply his depth of knowledge about everything he writes make his novels deeply committed and inspiring.  The reason for writing THE SOLOIST is probably one of encouraging his readers to live in the moment.  But it is the loving manner of relating his tale that gets us there, almost without knowing we've arrived.  A fine book to encourage a whole town (Pasadena) to read and share as is the goal here.

While it does fit, it would slip out of the smaller clips on the left side of the case that hold the device every once in awhile. Finally, after having it for only 4 days, one of the clips snapped. So, needless to say I'm looking for a new case...

Here's what I liked about the case:
 - Very thin, and didn't add much bulkiness to the device
 - Nice thick cover with soft inside, made me feel that the screen would be protected.
 - The faux-leather cover dosen't look too ""fake""

What I didn't like:
 - The band that is made to hold the device closed. I stopped using it after the first day. Don't they know that this will just break off? Plus, the cover stays closed well on it's own.

It starts with a cattle drive of Herefords (not the longhorn cattle of the mid-19th century). Men ride up shooting pistols to turn the herd. Horses are also driven. Three men make a stand by trees. The rustlers drive off the cattle. In town there is action at ""The Casino"". Tom gives $100 to his cousin and his friend, but this is refused. Bart Hammond owns the saloon and talks to his associates. He talks to two men and offers them a job as cooks. A rattlesnake causes a horse to run off until Miss Judy is rescued. Cattle will be driven to the railroad by Dave. Will the rustlers try again? Yes, when there are only two guards.

The cattle arrive in town to be loaded on the railroad for shipment. The cowboys want to celebrate in town. Will Dave play poker? The waiter switches a deck of cards! This lets the professional player win. [A lesson for the audience.] Tom explains his actions to Miss Judy. In town Tom sits in at the poker game and discovers the cold deck!

The cons are minor: what WAS a nice bright yellow is now more like orange.

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"I really enjoyed this book. It was a fun read that kept me interested. I couldn't help feeling for what Paige went through as a kid and how it shaped her life and her families. It truly shows how when one person in a family is ill, it affects everyone.

I'm glad that Paige grew up strong and was able to finally make her life away from her family, and have a little independence that she sorely needed. When Paige loses her job she pulls herself up and takes charge of her life and becomes her own boss.

A big move, but one she's ready for.

You'll really enjoy how both Paige and Jake grow. Because Jake is Paige's brother Matt's friend he is taboo to her, and vice versa. But somethings the heart wants what the heart wants.

Of course at times I wasn't always a fan of Jake's attitude, but as the book progressed he got better. I'm really looking forward to the next book in this enjoyable series.

Setting up a track was the hardest part. We bought 3 packs of Sure Track but only used 2 pack. We only used them on the elavated sections to keep it secure.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I've heard these speakers at my local computer store. These are the best sounding among all the brands offered. Klipsch didn't sound as good and Creative Labs' isn't even an option. The control center is the best design so far. The display and power button emit a cool blue light that is nice to see at night. Every component looks very sturdy. There are three possible connections - Coax, Optical, mini. You can use all for three different sources. Just press a button from the control center to indicate what source you would like to use. How good are these speakers?  I own a couple. It may not compare to my JBL HT system which are THX-certified for true home theater use, but these cost thousands. With the price you're paying for the Logitech, it's a steal. I have Harman/Kardon Sound Sticks for my Mac and these suck especially for the price. I had Sony Dream System  DAV-C990 which I returned after two weeks because the speakers are not only dull, they seriously need some equalization. Now for the cons:
1. The speaker cords are too thin and short. 2. The cord from the control center to the bass module is way too short and the manual warns against extending it. I want my bass in the corner of the room, and the control beside my PC. 3. The remote needs aesthetic improvement. These speakers have good, powerful bass right out of the box. Bass lovers will adore these for their games and music. Just reduce the bass from the control center if it annoys you. Best of all - these are THX-certified. You can't beat the price and quality. Even Apple has adapted these speakers for their upcoming G5 desktops. And if someone knows good design, these people do."

The noise is audible to people. Barely, but you can hear it. The noise is really high-pitched and irritating so instead of making my dog shut up, it just made him bark louder. You know how most dogs are with vacuum cleaners? That's how my dog is with the Bark-Off. He'll chase after it and bark bark bark until I turn it off. I tried leaving him alone with it on and it only agitated him further and made his anxiety worse. Save your couple bucks for something else."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,CG,"I'm pretty new to money, but I bought this wallet for my husband for a friend and he absolutely loves it.  The front pocket is perfect for the wallet, so it's easy to carry and it's convenient to carry your cards, credit cards, and other stuff.  The wallet is a bit smaller than I expected it to be, but the pockets are a little longer than I expected.  This wallet is a nice wallet for the price, and I like it so much that I have bought another one for my husband.  I'm very pleased with this wallet!

Overall, it's a nice wallet.  It's not too big, but it's not too small either.  It's a nice thin wallet for the price.  It's also a good quality.  It's not the best looking wallet, but I like it.  It's not really a bad wallet, but I'm not sure I would use it for anything other than driving.  It's a nice wallet.

I'm always looking for more of a good looking wallet than a cheap one.  I'm always looking for the best wallet that is comfortable to wear with all my other shoes.  I don't care for cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap and cheap.  This is the only one that I can wear all day with no problems.  It's still a nice wallet and a good value.Very comfortable.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"After a total house remod was done I wanted to clean a few area rugs to get them looking decent prior to giving them away or selling them for a few bucks.  This particular area rug was kept in the house through tile removal dust, walls being torn down, construction workers, etc., it was filthy and I thought for sure it had stains that would not come out but boy was I wrong!  I could not believe how much dirt came out with this Hoover, much more than meets the eye so it definitely does a good deep cleaning.  I had to fill the water and solution containers and empty the extracted dirty water several times but it was worth the time and effort to get this rug clean, so much so that I've decided to keep this one as it almost looks new!  It's so nice to have a carpet cleaner in the house that I can just whip out when I have an extra hour to brighten up the rugs.  I always dreaded going to the store to rent one, lugging it home and back to the store when done.  This Hoover will pay for itself in a year.  In the first pic you can see how much cleaner the left strip of the rug is compared to the right side.  The 2nd pic was taken after I was done.
Pros:  It does a great job cleaning, better than I expected.  It's very easy to put together and use.  All the containers slip in and out of place with ease.  I like that the cord is not so long to where you have to carry it around or worry about it getting caught in the wheels.
Cons:  If your rugs are super dirty as this one was, be prepared to fill the water container and empty the dirty water many times.  This won't be an issue for maintenance once the first deep cleaning is done."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"UPDATE May 20th ... Eh, now that I have actually seen this bag in person (ordered and shipped direct to Mom for Mother's Day) today was the first time I saw it myself ... gotta take away one star .. and have to agree with the other reviewer regarding the (newly discovered!) shoulder strap attachments, or lack thereof.

I finagled the strap to attach on both sides via the metal attachments holding the short handles; one clip on one side and one on the other. It works, but it is kinda tacky looking. Strap stays out of the way and the bag is balanced, but it doesn't look good.

The bag is much larger than I figured it was going to be.  It's one thing to SAY x"" x x"", but you really have to SEE it to comprehend it. It's okay, but it is a little 'large'.

The cute little 'bow' on the front that sold me actually works and when you unfasten it it makes that tan flap flip up and reveal a tiny pocket under it.  Great storage for cash or credit cards, maybe a SMALL cell phone if you don't need it quick.

Tons of space in the main compartment but nothing zippered. Three individual compartments and the main compartment.

In my opinion, it's a better handbag than a shoulder bag. It is cute, it appears to be well made, give that it is not genuine leather - that stuff has it's setbacks too though.

For the price, and if you are in need of a handbag, I'd say yes to this one.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ordered for Mom and she loves it! She says there is plenty of room, it's a great color, she loves the decorative 'bow' on the front ... all of it! Just a complete success!

Arrived Saturday before Mother's Day, gift wrapped as requested ... thanks so much!

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Native Tongue is an enjoyable book which translates well to riding a train, something I do every day, an hour each way. The story is crafted well enough to keep you interested, the characters are colorful, the underlying message is a decent one, and the book as a whole stands up well as I look back on it. Having said that, there's something in the narrative which makes you wonder about the author, if he's really a homicidal maniac waiting for you to stumble into his back yard.

That statement might sound a bit off-the-wall. I suppose I should admit to having read a magazine article about him recently. The book moves from colorful, with a hint of darkness, to a little edgy for the wrong reasons after you read more about the guy. Still, that shouldn't (and doesn't) take away from the book, which is a good way to pass the time on the train ride into the city.

The story is about man's encroachment on the various Florida lands that should be reserved for wildlife as opposed to, say, condos and parking lots. To be sure, this is an ever-growing problem which looms on society's horizon, only getting bigger by the day. In typical American fashion, the author takes this stand only *after* establishing his own residence in the state. ""Do as I say, not as a do,"" has never been more prevalent.

But the book isn't terribly serious. It's a whimsical fiction story which is easy to chew through at a good pace. Hiaasen is a good writer, and keeps the narrative moving well through the book. A bit peculiar in spots, the story nevertheless runs cohesively from start to finish, pausing occasionally to let you laugh at yet another silly kink in the story's chain.

All in all, a good book that's worth the read. Will definitely buy more of this author's work."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,CG,I find it interesting that this book is the first in a series by this author. I just can't get enough of her books. I can't wait to read more of her books. The author takes her time to develop a strong character. I love her characters and the way that the story flows. I liked the way the story line was told and the characters were so well developed. I just wish there was more to the story. The story was interesting and well written. The characters were well developed and the storyline was interesting.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"First impressions are that this computer is FAST.  I mainly use this web browsing, and the speed is 10x faster than my old laptop (which was a cheaper $250 version).  Opened multiple tabs at once - no issues.  Netflix is WAY faster than my old computer too.  I have not tried word processing, etc, but I'm sure it will be fine.  Google apps are easy to browse/find.  I would recommend this to anyone, especially as it is much cheaper than any other option.
Update: after about a week, I'm still very pleased with this Chromebook.  As some reviewers have said, the display is not that great for watching Netflix (it still streams faster than my previous laptop), but is perfect for web browsing etc. Also, I use a Nike running (GPS) watch that I tried to connect to the Chromebook, but found out there is no app for it :>(
But for me, the price, speed, (and hopefully) longevity is worth it."

She had a very sensitive ear so it was a challenge to get this ear off. The first ear was a little messy, but it worked fine. The second ear was a little rough but she didn't mind it at all. I am not sure if it is a good product or if it is just the ear but I have tried both. I will definitely continue to buy these ear pads.I bought this for my dog who has a sensitive ear.

It's easy to put together and I can't be sure it will last.  I don't have to worry about it breaking down at all and it's a good size for our dogs.  It is well made and it works well.  The only downside is that it doesn't fit my dogs.  I haven't tried it yet, but I'll see if it works.  My dog is very picky and I have to be careful of her and that's what she likes to do.

Karen can spin a story that makes the reader want to read more and more - not wanting it to end.
In this debut novel, Karen demonstrates her ability to weave a huge web that eventually comes back,together in synchronicity. The characters show their emotions and are extremely protective of their own.  Great action with just the right amount of human and compassion."

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Once my daughter saw this at her 3rd birthday, she was not interested in anything else. This helps teach fine motor skills and my daughter caught on right away. She's doesn't quite understand to go from hole to hole in order - she wants to skip all over the board. Also - this is a great relaxing activity for a tired mom to sit with their child and point to which hole to go into next to teach the child.

There are pictures on both sides of the board and the board is sturdy. The animals that come in this are: dog, cat, turtle, rabbit, fish. Some cons that I've found just in the day we've had this are: the holes are NOT smooth so when the lace goes through the hole, it gets frayed a little and is sometimes difficult to pull through the hole. The lace doesn't get frayed enough to dissuade me from purchasing this though. Also, I think that lace should be a little longer. There is barely enough lace to go around the entire animal and with a toddler who doesn't understand to go from hole to hole, a longer lace would be nice.

Overall, I am happy with my purchase. My daughter loves this and it keeps her occupied for 30-45 minutes at a time and is great for a quiet activity at church or wherever. She loves the pictures and the wooden (rather than cardboard) pictures are perfect so we can get a lot of use out of this. Hope this review helps!"

I thought my old vacuum was great but I did a pass with that then I did a pass with the Hoover and was grossed out!!!

I would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants a good quality vacuum, and these are a great value for the money.I bought this for my daughter to use with her headboard.  It was easy to install and did not require the use of a plastic cap.  The blade is a little long but it works great.  The brush works well and is a bit easier to use.

My heart was beating so fast and I had to put the book down a few times, I was so nervous about what was going to happen. This book takes on a serious situation and I thought L.G. Castillo handled it brilliantly. Seeing Cassie deal with what happened was heartbreaking and watching her over come it was empowering. This book had me yelling at both characters and praying that things would finally go right for them. Since I read this on a kindle at 71% I literally had to put the book down and take a moment to recover from what I had read. My heart just couldn't take anymore and the emotions I had, it was overwhelming but I needed to make sure these characters were going to be ok...they needed to be ok!

The Story of Cody and Cassie is heartbreaking and beautiful. I can't tell you enough how this book with so few pages can give you so much and make you feel like you read an entire novel with so many feels, good and bad. This series is amazing, she did a phenomenal job telling this story. This is the last book in the Cody and Cassie story and I loved how everything come to a close. This book/series is AMAZING!!!!!

I have a 10 year old Lab and he is pretty picky. He likes the Vetri Pet Dog Drink. I like the fact that this is a small fountain and there is no waterfall. I have been feeding him this for a few days and he seems to have no complaints. I would definitely recommend it. I bought this for my pitbull puppy. It's a little large but it fits her great. I put it on her and she just loves it. It's a good size and she is well-behaved. My dogs love this food. It is a bit pricey, but it is the best I've found for them. They love the taste and the nutrition. I've used it twice now and they both love it."

I will buy another pair in different colors and sizes.I like the color of this purse, it is very light weight and the color is very feminine.  I ordered a size small and it fits well, but the pouch is a bit large.  I can't say how much I like it, but it's a nice purse.I bought these for my husband to wear for a Christmas event. He wears a size 11 and they fit him perfectly. My husband said they are comfortable and they are very well made. They are very soft and the fit is perfect. The band is a little small and the back of the shirt is just right. They are also very comfortable and would be great for casual wear. They are a little baggy and do not have a zipper on them.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I love these headphones.  I used them every day on my commute to and from work - train, subway.  The noise cancelling is truly impressive.  When you put these on (powered off) they already block a lot of sound.  Switch them on (best in a noise environment - even a bathroom with the vent on or a car with the a/c on) and it's magical how everything grows very silent.  The sound is very good too - I loved my Sony MDR-V6 headphones for years and my initial impression was that the Bose was not quite as good.  Then after a couple weeks listening to the Bose I went to put on my Sony's and was dismayed to find that they no longer fit me well and the sound was no longer special.  These are much more comfortable and the ear cups are larger to fit my whole ear.  Back to the noise cancellation - it works like this:  you sit in a quiet car in the train station parking lot, and listen to music at a low volume.  The train arrives and you hop on.  The overall noise level is very high - the air system is very noisy, the sound of the train moving, conversations around.  However you don't have to adjust the volume of your music - it sounds just as good.  You take the headphone off your ear to compare, and grin like a loon at just how quiet they are!  I've stood next to a locomotive waiting for the train to open in the station, and using my phone sound pressure level app discovered that the noise is between 95 and 100 decibles - that's really loud.  With my headphones on i certainly heard the engine but again, didn't need to raise the volume of my music - it's that effective."

Think about a life where water is rationed and that water is suddenly gone. Where that one man decides the fate of all who live in those areas when water no longer available. Exiled is a great story with many strong, likable (and hated) characters in a realistic, future world. What starts out as a normal day for Brooke and her two children soon turns into a race to leave their home when she realizes that something is not right. The story jumps across the United States, following this corrupt man and his opponents as he pushes through a vile piece of legislation dealing with the waterless area.

The movie represented many such postal relationships that expressed love and hope while in a war that promised neither. It's that lifeline that matters in every conflict and keeps us human in an inhumane situation.

It engages her mind to put in food, peanut butter, or a treat.  She will work on it to get the food out.  When she gives up, to keep it sanitary, you can put it in the top rack of your dishwasher.

Further, to have more fun, roll it on a hard floor or driveway and it won't roll straight.  It will give your dog something to chase and pounce on.  Again, this will make life a bit more interesting for them.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Double Fudge"". . . This book once again focuses on the book's main character Farley Drexel Hatcher (B.K.A. ""Fudge""). He is absolutely hilarious in this book. His obsession with money, his twin cousins and their little brother nicknamed ""Mini"", along with their parents are another interesting twist in this story. Peter Hatcher, Fudge's  older brother, who is now an official ""junior high school student"",  typically experiences all of the anxiety that is associated with  early adolesence.
This book made me laugh and laugh, especially the reaction of Mr. Hatcher when he discovers that their his cousins  want to stay at their house longer than a week.
I was also able to put myself in  many of the situations and generally grasp a feel each of the characters.
The first book that I ever read in the Fudge series was ""Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing"" followed by ""Superfudge"". I can remember attending Jefferson Elementary School in Little Rock, Arkansas waiting in line for what seemed like an infinity, to have first bid on checking out that book. I became a ""reader beaver"" thanks to Judy Blume and the wonderful staff at Jefferson Elementary who encouraged all students to build their foundation through reading. I used to walk swifly through the library with the rest of my classmates running straight towards the ""B"" fiction section --shouting, ""Ready or not here I come.""
This is an excellent read, and it is authors like Judy Blume who grasp the interest of young readers by  making her work interesting and identifiable to young readers. Thank you Ms. Judy Blume for providing great reading material for children of all ages!"

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"So this is a series novel....not a big fan of those. Since this book is the start of the series, you would think that the author would have taken her time setting the story up. When the H and h meet for the first time the chemistry is instantaneous. I'm okay with because sometimes in life you meet a person and that can happen. HOWEVER, to have these two meet have sex and then decide they are in love? I'm calling straight BS on that. And what man wants to dive head first into some woman's drama because she's so beautiful and he just has to have her in his life?  And here we go once again with the black woman always having green eyes ,hazel eyes, light brown eyes,etc. Why not just beautiful brown eyes? I'm being petty sorry. Anyway the story although good moves along way too fast for me. They meet..she introduces him to her drama...he protects...they have sex...her life gets threatened again...there's a big dramatic scene with the villain H saves the day... this time they have unprotected sex...then proposes like a week later or three months later...either way. Too soon. I like it when a relationship gets to marinate the characters get to know each other the chemistry and suspense build up so that we can genuinely be excited when the two main characters come together...none of that happened here."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I've had a super-cheap yoga mat from TJ Maxx for the last ten years.  I purchased it for a couple of yoga classes I took years back and really haven't used it much since.  If and when I occasionally practice yoga, Pilates or Lotte Berk at home, I just work-out on the carpeted floor.  I ordered this on a whim, thinking it would just be a typical, teeny-tiny thin yoga mat to replace my old one.

But boy, I could not have been more wrong.

This is a high quality, super thick and about 50% longer than a standard yoga mat so it can be used for all manner of floor work.  It's lightweight (for easy portage) but still very supportive.  It rolls out pretty much flat (just one edge maintained a bit of a curl) and is easy to keep rolled up for storage with a convenient Velcro carrying strap that wraps tightly at both ends.  However, I wouldn't recommend it as a substitute for the yoga mat you might typically carry to a class because it's about twelve inches around when rolled.  But it's perfectly suited for home use.

(Just don't leave it standing in your living room if you have cats.  Because it I discovered it works pretty well as a scratching post, too!)"

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Strangers With Candy is a perfect send-up of insipid topical  teen shows like My So-Called Life and the After School Specials that spewed conformist propoganda into the ears and eyes of America's youth every weekday afternoon during the 1980's.  I remember watching it back when I had cable, as well as a slew of other top-notch shows that were on Comedy Central at the time (Upright Citizens Brigade, The Daily Show, South Park, T.V. Funhouse etc...).  Strangers With Candy may not have been the best of these shows, or even the edgiest, but it very well may have been the darkest.  South Park and T.V. Funhouse were/are certainly caustic and dark, but 'Strangers' was pitch black.  This humor is truly without reverence.  Nothing is sacred, all is petty, and the mere concept of morality itself becomes the joke.

Comedy Central is truly a great network.  Whenever possible, complete creative freedom is given to (gasp!) the CREATORS of the show.  Strangers With Candy certainly benefitted from this policy; its vision is clearly uncompromised.  Every aspect of the production contributes to a consistent representation of a unified concept.

I recently rented the first and second seasons and the latter is the better of the two.  I am looking forward to renting the third season.  If you are a fan of black comedy, Strangers With Candy will tickle your funny bone - and then break it."

Mortimer is fresh on the job but Heidi doesn't make it easy for him. She is not scared and in fact they become fast friends that blooms into much more. Rules are broken and consenquences are to be had. This is a side of the Boogeyman that you won't see coming. This is a paranormal but with a twist. It is not all the bad that comes with being the Boogeyman, but the sweet that people see in each other."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Boston Medical Examiner Maura Isles is called to a gruesome scene early on Christmas morning, where a young woman has been brutally killed and dismembered, with satanic symbols all around her body and the Latin word ""Peccavi"" (I have sinned) scrawled backwards across her bedroom wall. Detective Jane Rizzoli, back on the job after maternity leave, suspects a serial killer is on the loose when Maura's nemesis, psychiatrist Joyce O'Donnell, is murdered in the same manner. Dr. O'Donnell was part of a group of scholars from around the world calling themselves the Mephisto Club that track demons. When members of this group are murdered and Maura's life is threatened, the action moves to Europe in search of a young woman whom the Mephisto Club is certain will draw the demon to them.

This captivating thriller touches on a fascinating subject: demonology, its origins and presence in the world today. Gerritsen's outstanding characterization is once more on display along with a thrilling, fast-paced plot. Jane Rizzoli remains a strong character, a jaded woman whose marriage and baby have become a calming force. Maura is a lonely woman intrigued by a priest, and this relationship is a painful one for Maura as well as the reader, who longs for Maura's happiness. Gerritsen offers a galvanizing look at Rizzoli's parents, the two people who shaped her, which helps the reader understand her cynicism and insecurities. An electrifying read."

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,CG,"This was an Amazon freebie and I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review.

While I read the first two books, I didn't really care for the rest of the story. The first one was really good, but the second one was really bad. There was no real story to it.

I did get a little frustrated with the hero and heroine, but I didn't really care about them. I think that they were all just a bunch of idiots.

I really liked the hero, and I really liked the heroine. She was a strong heroine who had a lot of issues. She was a bit naive at the beginning, but she grew on me as the book progressed.

I really liked the villain, and he was a good guy. He was a bit of a jerk, but I didn't care about him.

I really liked the ending. I was hoping that there would be a sequel. It didn't really happen.

I did like the other characters, but I didn't like the ending. I would have liked to have had more characters.

I really liked the ending. It was a nice little surprise.

Overall, I was really impressed with this book. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good story, with some twists and turns.

The photos aren't as vivid as the video, but they're clear, and the image is crisp and clear.

The only issue I have is that it's not very compact. If you have a large camera, it's a bit heavier, but the camera's capacity is a little larger than it is on the camera body.

I'm considering purchasing a second camera, but for now, it's a great camera.I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife who is in her mid-30's.  She loves it and it has worked flawlessly.  We use it as a Christmas gift and we love it.  It is a great camera for the price.  I recommend this camera to anyone with a camera in the 50's.I bought this to replace my old Bluetooth headphones that I had on the ear of my husband.  He loved the sound of the headphones and the fact that they are made of durable material.  I love that it has a built in speaker that can be used to connect to the back of the ear while still being comfortable.  It's perfect for my husband's ears.  I also like the fact that it has a small speaker.  He uses it to listen to his music while wearing it.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"This was my second waring blender. Previously, I had one that was a bit shorter. This one can fit a lot of liquid, but apparently it is not meant for crushing ice. Huh? It is a bar blender. What is it for then? I only found this out because when my husband accidentally broke ours by blending a few cubes of ice (along with milk, bananas, yogurt), we contacted waring to see if it was under warranty and if it could be replaced. The blender would turn on but the blade didn't seem to be spinning anymore. Waring asked if we had used ice in the blender ""because it wasn't designed to crush ice."" We explained that t had, but only a small amount. Long story short, waring offered a once in a blue moon replacement blender top, but ""just this time."" Two to 3 weeks later it had still not arrived. My husband contacted the lady to ask her if she had shipped the replacement, because we really just wanted to know if we needed to buy a new blender so we could make smoothies in the mornings again. The replacement blender is $60-100, depending on where you buy it, so yeah we were waiting for the free one. The blender finally arrived, after hassling the lady again. I stuck my hand in the box and hundreds of shard of glass sliced into my skin. So, that was nice. The blender had been barely bubble wrapped. We didn't bother requesting a new one, and bought an entirely different blender instead. We bought the Farberware 4-speed  digital blender for $40.00 and have been happilly blending ever since. I used to be a blender snob, but unless you are going to fork over the money for a BlendTec or Vitamix, or something along those lines, there is really no point to spend a lot. I'm sorry but if a waring blender can't make a semi-frozen smoothie, what can it do? Puree soups?"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,I've been waiting (mostly patiently) for the third book in the Weston Family series.  I loved the first one so much and was sad to hear the publisher dropped the series.  Henry's book was worth the wait.  I loved that the conflict facing the couple was not external to them but internal fears that the Diana most conquer before getting her happily ever after.  After reading so many books that have gentlemen spies or villains it was nice to read a book that focused on the characters and their relationship.  I loved this book and hope that more Weston books will be coming.

She had no issues with it, which was great. This was recommended to me by her veterinarian and it's great for her to keep ear clean and be able to adjust her ear to the noise level. It does make her nervous as it is on a sensitive ear. This product works great on my dogs ears. I have a 50# Rottweiler with a sensitive ear. This has helped immensely. I have used it on both dogs. We have a rescue dog and I use this on them both. I can't say enough about this product. My dog was able to tolerate it for a very long time. I would recommend this to anyone who has a sensitive ear. I have a dog who is a rough chewer. She is a 5 pound dog and this is the only product she will eat. She loves it. It's very strong and she doesn't seem to mind the smell of it.

Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"I got these because they look great, like equipment you might find on the spaceship in 2001: A space Odyssey.  I was tempted to keep them just for that. The problem is that I don't like using them.

For this price I didn't expect them to sound great, and they don't, but they are good enough for audio books and podcasts. Turns out they are uncomfortable for me. I think they could be comfortable with velour pads instead of the synthetic leatherette material. I think the leatherette material is meant to provide sound isolation, but in fact these headphones offer no appreciable sound isolation.

The biggest problem is the severe cord noise. I hear this noise even with small head movements. Heretofore, I had heard this kind of noise only with earphones (in-ear monitors), never with headphones. It's strange that only one other reviewer has complained about the cord noise with these headphones.

I might add that these headphones are larger than they look in the photo. They are large enough that I'd almost call them clunky. They are much larger than the better-sounding Sennheiser PX100, which are my favorites in lightweight portable supra-aural headphones.

Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"It appears that Arcos has skimped to make this a cheaper model. A MAJOR negative that the potential capacity is really a lot less than perceived. This is due to the inconceivable absence of ANY expansion via SDHC cards or any other flash cards. The greatly limits flexibility. It is always an important idea to leave a considerable amount of empty space on the locked up, internal flash of the unit, as performance several degrades, as the internal flash fills up. As it gets around 70%, besides the performance issues, sort issues, there is a much grater chance of database and OS, issues, because of the needing of large work areas, that are not available. Not allowing external expansion from SDHC, truly helps this situation. I guess this also forces Archos customers to HAVE to get propriatary Archos units and drives to expand at all. Skip this unit (however DON'T get a Ipod)."

The script and directing have been superbly executed, and the story is well told. The acting is strong, and the performances are always excellent. The film also has a very good cast, and it has a very good ending. I think the ending is a good one, and I'm not sure if that's because it's a good ending, or if it's just because it's the ending. I think the ending is a little confusing, and that's what makes it a little more confusing. If you want to see a movie that is full of action and laughs, I recommend this film. It's not a perfect film, but it's a good one. I highly recommend this movie for any fan of action. It's a good movie, but not one that you'll be very happy with. It's a lot of fun to watch and there is a lot of action in it. The plot is a bit complex, but I really enjoyed it. The acting is excellent and the plot is a bit convoluted.

I just went with the XL and it's just a bit loose.  I would not recommend these for any other purpose.These are great.  I love the fit.  They are a little too tight, but not too tight.  The only negative thing is that the fabric is a little thick.  I'm 5'4"" and 140lbs, and they are a little short in the torso, so I'm going to keep them for a short while.  I'm still wearing them, but not as much as the reviews suggest.  I like them a lot, but they are a little long on the torso, so I might have to order another pair.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Was easy to setup and works very well. We unplugged the COX modem, but did NOT remove the battery (the instructions say the battery should be removed). We waited about 15 seconds, and then turned on the COX modem, after connecting it to the wifi router (which was turned on).  The 1 yr old HP laptop found the TP-Link router and easily connected with the provided password on the box (rather tiny font). Then, we went to the 198.etc. address and changed the signin and the password to our satisfaction. The COX modem, if connected with the cord, gets us 90+mbps, and 7+mbps upload; without the cord, ie., wifi only, a few inches away, we get 85+mbps. When we took the laptop down the hallway and 2 rooms away (it is an old brick house), we got 45+mbps, which is far above what is needed for videos - a min of 10mbps for smooth viewing-, and the same 7+mbps upload rate. Amazing."

She did not disappoint.  Don't let the fact that it is a YA book deter you.  It is still a wonderful story that kept me engaged.  I read it in less than 24 hours.

I really enjoyed Jessie's story and her coming to terms with her mother's death and finding out her biological father is a rock star.  I'll never be in that exact situation but it was fun and full of drama but still realistic and down to earth if that makes sense.  It was easy to relate to Jessie.  It was also fun catching up with Meg and Johnny.

I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars because I do feel that some of situations in the book were a bit mature for younger audiences.  There is drinking, and smoking.  *spoiler alert* The characters don't go further than kissing but I feel that some terms used were a bit mature.  That's probably just me though.

Overall, wonderful story I know I will probably reread."

This book is Joey and Alexa's story. The story begins with a lot of background information about both Joey and Alexa when they were children and flips back and forth from past to present. Alexa grew up next door to Joey and was witness to the horrific childhood abuse he endured. As a result they became friends and lovers as their relationship grew. I loved Alexa's character; she is strong, beautiful, brave and totally devoted to Joey. Joey was also amazing and truly loves Alexa but needs to find his own inner peace in order to feel he is worthy of Alexa.

Now with all the guests gone, we've brought it upstairs to replace our rusting Kitchen Aid stove-top kettle.

I love how quickly it heats, even when full, and is super handy when I want to quickly heat small amounts of water.

I've had no construction issues with the kettle in the 2 months we've owned it.

The one annoying design issue I had (which is more user err than anything) pertains to the location of the 'on' light.

I'd plugged the kettle in with the handle facing me and hit the on switch but saw nothing indicate it was on. I was like a monkey trying to figure out why the darn thing would turn on...then I realized the light was on the side of the kettle I could see.

'On' light should be by 'on/off' switch.

of the main characters after a so-called parachuting accident is a
good twist. Also the flashbacks and the reappearance of intelligence

Books_5,5.0,OR,"In this case, the clich is true...I just couldn't put this book down.  This book was recommended to me, and I started reading it with no knowledge of what it was about.  From the very first chapters, it was apparent that the author had a gift for storytelling.  He was able to assemble the story, the facts, the characters and the energy in a way that leaves the reader begging for more.

Each chapter dramatically reveals new information, only to end with new questions arising.  As a result, I found it impossible to find a good spot to stop reading.  Five hours later, I finished the book, completely sated and thrilled that this book found its way into my hands."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"If you haven't read anything in the Wine of the Gods series...book 18 is not a good place to start.  I really like this universe (multiverse?), but there are so many characters and so much about the world(s) that is hinted at it becomes a bit overwhelming.  Unless you have read the whole series and have the background.

That being said, for those of you who are fans this adds a wonderful new group of magic users to the mix.  Having some new blood to add to the already defined groups should shake things up nicely.  We also see more action by mage compass's, which is a nice change from the usual witches pyramids.  Some of the first hints of a coming tech/magic revolution that may make the industrial revolution look like a minor upgrade.  A whole new pyramid also is peeking around the edges.

Now for the bad:  Much as I like this world ^and^ the writing, this is not a good short story.  This is more of a chronology of what happened.  While some of the characters learned new skills or information, we did not.  More about filling in the blanks and backstory than developing a character.

There is a teaser at the end of the book showing the next(?) in the series that gives me a lot of hope.  The Sea Kings!!  An almost unexplored area.

In closing, I liked it.  Fans will like it.  Everybody else needs to start earlier in the series, if not at the beginning, and develop a love for this world in order to appreciate this story."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Well J.T. Fox hit every romance book must for me:

Angst-check
Hot men-check
Steamy sex-check

All of the above nicely rounds out the story of Eric and Jordan, two football players looking to finally stop playing games when it comes to love.

Eric is a hot shot quarterback that is use to getting what he wants. Jordan is the up and comer, who knows all about Eric Higgins, including his sexual preference. When these two are finally in a room together, there are nothing but fireworks. Super sexy fireworks between them.

I loved how forceful Eric came off at first, with Jordan giving back as much as he was taking. Even the banter between these two was scorching hot. Both men are on the down low while their careers are in the spotlight, however they still want to take a chance on each other.

Playing Hard was a quick sexy read that left me wanting much, much more. As I read, I knew things couldn't be this easy for two high profile football players looking to stay in the closet, and I was right. J.T. Fox gives us an excellent first book to the Hot for Him series.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I'm commenting here only about a belated experience to remark about the resiliency of this unit to water. In an attempt to move my jacket out of the way in boarding a kayak in fresh water (Rainbow River, Fl), one of the pockets of the gore-tex jacket accidentally hung out of the craft (unbeknowngs to me) when my partner sitting behind me said ""one of your pockets is in the water"". Yep, it had the Canon camera in it; it had been submerged inside the pocket for about a full minute (perhaps longer), but the pocket hadn't pooled with water, only was wet inside. Needless to say, it appeared to be a goner. The viewfinder had beads of water inside, and the screen inside showed condensation and water droplets. Also, the battery compartment had some water in it, but not pooled, but enough that I could pour out several drops from it. I removed the batteries, and over a period of about 60 hours, exposed the camera to sunlight on the dashboard and inside the glove compartment to dry out. It gradually dissapated the droplets inside the viewfinder, and the condensation from the inside screen disappeared. Only at that time did I attempt to turn it on. I couldn't believe it! The 4GB SD card was intact with the pics, and the motor successfully retracted the lens. A few trial pics confirmed that the camera is now back in working order. Call it luck, but patience prevailed in letting natural sunlight and warmth bring it back to life. I'm impressed with this experience."

My only motivation for staying awake was the gnawing belief that surely  at some point a plot would finally emerge to justify enduring the lack thereof heretofore.  But it finally dawned on me as the credits rolled that I had been had.  What I don't understand is why the critics or Alton think that sitting through hours of watching people, one would barely tolerate in real life, chat about nothing for 2 hours constitutes an important film or even entertainment for that matter.  And I happen to like good English film. But if I am to give up 2 hours of my life, I just think there should be a point."

The one on the left is the one I had last year on my first outing with the gun and my Dad had one of these as a present.  I like that the one on the right is a special one for me and my Dad.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Update:  I received the 600 Professional today.  First off,  this filter is very large.  It completely dwarfs both my Fluval 305 and
Marineland 350 Magnum.

I also notice that like my Fluval 305,  the Hydor is manufactured in Italy.  Something I find interesting,  given all of the aquarium
filters that are made in China.

The 600 PRO is well  constructed,  with five media baskets:  two for mechanical filtration and three for biological filtration.

The motor housing for this filter is solid and well designed, and the motor itself  is completely silent.

The motor head is secured to the 600 PRO's canister  with front and back clamps, as well as side levers which offer
a tighter seal.

Even the media trays have nice adjustable plastic straps which allow for easy removal of media, and the trays themselves fit snugly into the 600 PRO's chassis, stacked atop one another.

Aesthetically,  the entire  Hydor Professional series has a refreshingly industrial look,  which exudes quality.

The fact that this filter was discounted by about $80 from its list price only makes the aforesaid that much better.

If the Hydor 600 PRO stands up as well as my Fluval 305 and  Eheim Classic filters have, I will consider this to be money well spent.

Highly recommended!

I have been considering purchasing one of these filters since they came out.  However, they were selling at list price for quite awhile.
So I decided to wait  until the prices became more reasonable.  I just found a brand new 600 for sale on Amazon for about $150, so I decided to purchase it.  Will update my experiences.  Based on what I have read about these filters thus far, I've left four stars.

This is the largest canister filter I have ever purchased.  I also own a Marineland Magnum 350 and a pair of Fluval 305s (350 GPH VS 260 GPH respectively), so at 345 GPH this will be about as large as the Magnum 350, even though the 600 dwarfs the 350 in size."

Yesterday, my husband was on his elliptical and a bolt landed on the floor. He could not find where it came from but, with the Halo light, I found where it came from in about 2 minutes.

Very bland! I kept paying for the episodes, thinking that there is no way that this isn't going to get better at some point. It never does.

I don't want to repeat all the justified criticisms concerning historical accuracy and incorrect military policy. What finally ended my reading was the endless repetitive 1,000+/1 battle losses of the axis forces vs. allied forces.

In any confrontation I came to realize there was no suspense involved. At some point in the battle a 21st century weapon would be brought to bear or sabotage would result in an allied victory with minimal losses.

It has been great to have on hand for spreading out large / odd shaped oversized plugs/transformer blocks and for splitting UPS outlets to be able to plug in several small devices.  Only downside is also its positive - the product is heavy weight plus a bit bulky so it makes packing it in my laptop bag (for when traveling and a hotel or airport doesn't have enough outlets) a bit much.  Also, in other uses, it can be a bit hard to cable manage all of the transformer blocks when the weight of the splitter is enough to move pull on the transformer block.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This doorbell easily installed on my chain link gate with the included sticky pad.  I placed the ringer on a plastic board and fastened the board against the fence.  Most of the rings are digital music.  There are eight ""ring"" options on this doorbell which was sufficient for our needs.  The second loudest setting can be heard down the hallway through a closed door.

Waterproofing is as advertised. I frequently water my bushes with the gate open, and the ringer gets drenched.  It's also held up well in the southern California sun, with the battery lasting over 8 months already.  You will have to unscrew the circuit board to get to the battery, which is going to be a pain when the battery needs replacement.

It didn't giggle very well after it was dropped in the water bowl, but once the water FINALLY got shaken out of it, it's giggle came back!

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"**UPDATED AT THE END**

When we got our new dog, my wife and I decided that we were only going to go with good products that didn't contain any harsh chemicals! After searching around a little, we decided on Cain & Able because I love the smell of Peppermint and Tea Trea is a wondrous plant!

GENERAL
First off, this shampoo smells great out of the bottle! It's not too strong after our puppy is dry, but it really does leave a very nice smell on her. I can't say that the pump is as bad as some people have mentioned, but then again we only have a 21lb dog so we don't have to use all that much on her!

EFFECTIVENESS
We have noticed less itching from our dog, something that has nothing to do with fleas, but according to our vet probably something to do with her diet before we got her (she was a street rescue). She doesn't seem to desire to lick it once she has been washed, but even if she did we feel a lot better knowing that there are no artificial perfumes and chemicals that might be bad for her! We can't comment on the effectiveness of being an insect repellent, but both of the main ingredients are known to be natural repellents and we feel safe knowing she is protected!

WHY 5 STARS??
- Great value for a safe and earth-friendly product
- Smells GREAT!
- Contains no harmful chemicals!

OVERALL
Overall we are very happy with this purchase, and our puppy seems to love it! I highly recommend this product, especially if you care about what seeps into your dog's skin!

**UPDATE 03/2012**
We have been using this shampoo exclusively for over 5 months now, and we are still VERY happy with it! Our dog doesn't itch at all any more and her coat is shiny (a good diet greatly helps this)! We will continue buying this product unless we happen upon anything better!"

I wish it came in the plastic one so it would hold up to the biting and biting. I would have liked it if it had a thicker plastic bowl. I would have liked to have gotten it in the plastic one instead. It has a very thin plastic base, so I wish I had bought it in the plastic one. I will have to check the size on the next time. I will update this review as I see it. I am really glad I bought this product. I would not have bought it in the plastic one. I have been using this to keep my dogs ears clean for several years and I have found it to be effective. It is very absorbent and absorbs more than my other shampoo products. I have not had any issues with skin irritation as a result. My cats love this food. They are about 20 lbs. They have been eating it for several years. The cats have never had any issues with the food, and I believe that it is a healthy food for them. I also have the odd cat that we mix with it, which is quite a challenge for us. The food is good quality and the cats love it. I will be ordering more of the other brands. Great quality. My dogs love it. I bought this for a friend who has a dog with a sensitive stomach.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I was given an ARC copy of this to read and review by the author, however I enjoyed it so much I purchased a copy for myself.

This is book two in this new series by Georgette, however it can be read as a standalone. There are brief appearances from the first couple in the series so while it works on its own, I would suggest reading the first book anyway.

Cadence is half werewolf, half dragon. She never knew her father and was raised by her mother with no impact from her father or his family. Since her wolf was most dominant she was able to hide that she was half dragon, however she is changing. Her wolf is gone and her dragon side is beginning to take over. She is unable to hide it any longer and since dragon births are on the decline, she has no choice but to register and subject herself to a forced mating with a complete stranger. However fate was at work when her best friend, Daisy, happened to meet a dragon as he was being ejected by her aunts mating agency. Some quick thinking gets them both in the same room and that is where the real fun begins.

I love this world Georgette has created as well as the two sides to the dragons. The ice dragons and the fire dragons and the war that has always been simmering between them is so interesting. Cadence is an ice dragon and Orion is a fire dragon. They should hate each other, not be falling in love.

This one had action, forbidden romance and a lot of fun moments. One of Georgettes best books in my opinion and I definitely recommend to fans of paranormal romance."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This is such a cute little fake guitar.  It is push button rather than anything with real strings.  You play it by pushing the button where you would normally strum the guitar and you do ""fret"" work by pushing down on the interior of the fret section of the guitar.  There is a flip section that alternates the music between electric and acoustic.

My grandson is almost 18 months old and doesn't really know who Dora is as he watches very little on TV (and then only a couple of specific DVDs.)  We do, however, play a lot of instruments amongst the family - just in my house along there are over a dozen different instruments.  He even has a small ukelele of his own at his house that he plays with.  He grabbed the Dora guitar as soon as I showed it to him and showed him which buttons to push.  He ""played"" guitar all afternoon - carrying it around with him everywhere.  He would stop and start dancing and shaking his head to the tunes or would drop the guitar to clap - and then realize that he had to play it again to make the music continue.

The final move of the day was when he put it in his pop-up castle (along with his much beloved Fisher-Price piano keyboard) where it will wait until next week when he comes to my house again.  He loved it and played with it for hours.  His smile was so big, I wondered if it hurt his face to keep it up all afternoon. I'll probably pull out one of my guitars and then we can rock out together.

This is a really cute toy guitar and I recommend it highly.  I don't know why it is recommended for 3 years and up.  I don't see any small pieces that could be a hazard and my little guy loved it at 18 months."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"I have to say, I got this book out of chance and have to put out there that I feel bad I hadn't known about this title before.

This story is basically a modern day Romeo and Juliet but that hype of Shakespeares' master work never wore the story down for me. Kaitlin slowly falls for the one person her and her family have known to despise, however, as the reader starts to grasp the power of love in this novel...it gives judgment a whole new meaning.

Mary E. Pearson knows what she's doing. I love the surprise, twist'n turns and the balance of drama, romance, and mystery in this novel. I'd recommend this to any young adult who are looking for that classic love story that we all love with a guarantee of a soft, exciting, original teen love romance. This book will have you appreciate and be more hopeful for that special person that you may or may not have come across in life.

Scribbler of Dreams is what every young adult needs."

Having owned the GO 300 and selling that I have had the chance to play with this for a while. The screen is about twice as bright as the 300, about 1/3 the weight. The battery lasts about half of the 300s but as long as you can use the cigerette lighter thats not a problem. The speaker is surprisingly loud (louder than Garmin Nuvi 660, Magellan 3410 among others). The window mount is built very cheaply but you don't need a lot of strength as the ONE is very light. The features are light on this unit, no text to speech, bluetooth,etc but for what you need this is a terrific GPS. The touchscreen is very responsive compared to the Magellan.

This tired old trick was cute years ago with the Parent Trap.
But now it's dull now matter what type of plot they try.
This one is about a pot grower and a school teacher.
Maybe this might of been interesting if they had used real twins
as the actors.
Instead Edward Norton does a poor job of switching accents and
pretending to look at himself as a twin.
This very old visual trick never works.
You can tell when people do not make real eye contact with
each other.
This film might have even been interesting if they had used
two different actors who look kind of alike.
But overall it's not funny or full of action like Pinapple Express.

I tried it out and immediately felt the cooling sensation on the back of my neck and upper back but was it actually going to help keep me cool during the night to where I don't wake up from sweating. Yes! It did and does and I now do not sleep without this wonderful pillow. It has helped me get longer sleep since I'm not waking in the night. I am so pleased with this pillow and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is a hot sleeper like I am or even if you just like a cold feeling pillow. I love this pillow. I would not sleep on it alone though, I put it on top of my other pillow and it's perfect. I hope this helps you make a purchase!

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,CG,"This my Border Collie's favorite toy. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to find. I bought this for her for a friend's dog, and she had a very large ear. She had no issues with it, but it is hard to find for her.

I think it's great because it's so cute, and the colors are so bright."

Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"Madewell even though it is of plastic unlike the old traditional still dump trucks. I noticed that the dump area it's self is actually a lot smaller than it used to be. I'm a 5 foot two woman roughly about 110 pounds. When my kids played with this, my butt was able to fit the dump area believe it or not. However this is so tiny that my three-year-old nephew's but barely makes it into the  dump area. Kids now play with it just as they did then. Once sits in the dump truck and the other person pushes them around all over the house."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1.0,OR,"My initial impression of this shoe was that it was an over-priced, cheap shoe.  I confirmed my suspicions about the price when I went to a local Nike outlet, only to find it 30.00 cheaper.  Moreover, the sole wasn't cut in the same way of the original, i.e., in blocks intended to push apart to provide a natural shock impact.  Too narrow inside and out.  The sole outsole was wider in the original.  Maybe just buying the name here."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I wanted stainless steel food dishes that sat lower than the standard locking food cups for my ferrets, for use in a Ferret Nation Cage.  By mounting the holder rings upside down, this causes the bowls to wedge into the ring tighter, and thus defeats all ferret efforts to spill the contents. They've never managed it even once, but it's still easy for me to remove the bowls for cleaning and refilling. (Because there isn't a tab on the bottom of these bowls they also sit flat on the counter!) I'm much happier with these proportions and this look. I also have two 16 oz versions in our (cat-sized) travel crate.

Additional Note- The cups that were sent by HorseLovers are Spot brand (by Ethical Products) and are actually all stainless-steel (no black coating on the ring and clamp, which has eventually rusted on other coop cups), and I like the look of this better. They have a thicker, sturdier ring with a looser fit than other coop cups I've bought, so I had to bend the rings a tiny bit toward oval so that the rim of the bowl jams tight against the metal prongs on the back of the clamp. Not a big deal at all, and worth it for stainless steel and a sturdier make. These bowls look like they'll last a long time."

He likes that the strap is very convenient for his comfort. The shoe is comfortable, but the sole is not as nice as the front and back of the shoe.

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,CG,"""Beyond Borders"" was originally to be an animated movie, but was cancelled after only a year.  The story was not very good, but it was still fun to watch.  I enjoyed this movie.  It is a good film, and one I would watch again.The series was cancelled by a network after a season ended.  I had to wait a year for the new season.  I watched the new season on Netflix and decided to give it another shot.  I'm glad I did.  It's the best show ever.  This is a must have!

You will be glad you did!  A must have for any fan of the show.  I'm glad I gave it to a friend.I loved this movie. It was a good movie and I was impressed with the story. It was not the best of the bunch. I think the fact that it was not filmed in a location that I thought was a good location was a good thing. This movie is about a good guy, but he is always doing something bad. The movie was fun to watch, but was a bit long and the acting was not very good. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes good movies.I'm not a big fan of the old ""The Sting"" films, so I watched them for the first time on DVD with my 4 year old.  I didn't really like them, but I liked the new ones because they are a little different.  I love the fact that the old films were so much more accessible than the new ones.

I will definitely be buying this again!My cat loves these, but he is a picky eater. So I have to order a lot more of these for him. I will probably order another one for the next cat I have. He will be a little more picky, but I'll be happy to see how well these hold up. I have not tried the feather-like pads that are on the other brands, but they are very soft and seem to be working well. I think they are a good product for the price, but I'm not sure if it is the size of a large or a small cat. I also have the oddball size cat, and he loves the feather pad.

I have a fluval C2 5 stage filter, a 240gal/hr water circulator (fish don't live in stagnant water in the wild), and i use ""Prime"" water conditioner by Seachem.

I feed Drs Foster and Smith goldies flakes twice a day, and i make a seafood buffet of shrimp-clams-crab-salmon from the canned seafood department, and feed it twice daily also (one can of each, drained, finely chopped and mixed will last 3 months, so freeze it), alternate with the flakes.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"REVIEW OF:  TCP RLP381430WL 14W LED PAR38 40 DEGREE WET LOCATION RATED SPOT LIGHT BULB, WARM WHITE

This efficient bulb casts a nice bright light-Brightens the entire front of the house for added safety. This Light bulb's standard-sized base screwed in immediately to existing socket.

This indoor/outdoor LED light bulb exceeded expecations. Over the years energy saving bulbs have gotten better, but many still seem kind of dull and gloomy. Oftentimes, the bluish light just hurts your eyes.  How often have you consoled yourself with the thought that by compromising a nice light you are saving energy and money?  No longer.

This bulb is doing a great job of providing the outdoor porch with a nice warm, yet bright light. No creepy shadows where miscreants can hide!

A heavy bulb, it measures 5.2"" x 5.8"" x 5.9"".  It is rated to use 14 watts of energy, and at 1050 lumens it is theoretically equivalent to a incandescent 90 watt  bulb. This light bulb is fixed at that wattage and does not dim. One can expect this bulb to last about 25,000
hours.  Roughly that's about 5.7 years, assuming 12 hours of darkness a night (25,000/12/365=5.7 years.). Well, that'd be great and at $19.80 /bulb would give you outdoor weatherproof light for less than $3.50 a year.

The bulb should work well in most areas as it is rated to function at  temperatures ranging from  -4 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

Security is increased with brightly lit areas....................

I'd like to thank Amazon for the opportunity to review this indoor/outdoor LED light bulb that I received as a complimentary sample in exchange for this honest review.

I hope my review is helpful for you! Thanks for your time."

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"UPDATE 8/8/2012: I haven't had the case/cover for 3 months, yet...and it's already showing signs of falling apart. I use the case/cover at home and for one class I'm taking, and after a short 3 months it's surface material is cracking and starting to peel off where the cover folds (multiple locations). I do like the case, but it's going to look very ratty in a few more months. At this rate I'll need a case every 3-4 months and that quickly ads up over a year's time frame (which would be an acceptable amount of time for a single case/cover to survive).

Old Review: Great case for the iPad. This thing goes in and out of my back pack, loose leaf binder, and around campus. It's a simple design-in black-and most folks don't know it's an iPad until I open the cover. I just need to learn and not show off, so this fits the need perfectly. I would have given 5 stars, but I find the cover sometimes moves enough that the unlock screen will come on. In a side-by-side comparison, the Apple screen cover has about twice the hold of this one, but this one protects the whole device and helps my hands grip what would otherwise be the difficult to handle smooth aluminum back."

It is attractive, made of quality materials, and the bags are just the right size for a complete load without overstuffing the washer.

I tried the Arris SB6141 (8x4) which worked well until it died.  So I decided to try something else and liked the idea of this 16x4 model.  However, once I replaced the Zoom, it would only achieve 55 Mb/s download.  I tried multiple power resets, but even though it bonded with 16 download channels I would peak about 55 Mb/s.  I put the very old Zoom (4x4) back in and it went back to 82Mb/s,  There are no configurable parameters.  I had expected at least the same performance and possibly better than the very old Zoom."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Out of Frame is the third In Focus book that I've read and I really liked it!  The story is told in first person from the perspective of both main characters, Jay and Quinn. I always enjoy first person, and while this is a great way to get into the heads of both guys without resorting to third person, sometimes I found it a little confusing. Okay, I admit it, I'm not a young man anymore and maybe my short term memory isn't what it used to be.....  :) Erickson began each chapter with the name of the character telling it, so I guess the confusion wasn't the author's fault.

Anyway, I often like romance stories where opposites are attracted to each other. Jay and Quinn are very different but alike in many ways too. The plot contains a fair share of tension but I likes how the guys dealt with it.

Out of Frame was proofed well, and the Kindle formatting was very good on my iPad. This book is definitely on my 'recommend' list for those who like this genre!"

Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"I bought my first set of these headphones about a year ago.  I was able to look past the annoyingly long right ear wire because they do have excellent sound quality.  I used them mainly at the gym and noticed that after being on the treadmill for a few minutes that the combination of sweat and the weight of the cord would pull the left earpiece out.  I tried all 3 rubber sizes but was constantly pushing that left piece back in.  Also, when lifting weights I run the cord under my shirt and found that the thick rubber piece where the right and left earphones split would catch my shirt and again pull the left earpiece out, even more often than while running.  This was annoying, but I would still have rated these 4 stars because walking my dog or listening in bed these were the best phones I ever heard.  I bought 2 other pairs as Christmas presents last year, and now all 3 pairs have failed in one ear.  I tried re-soldering the wires and got 2 of them to work again, who knows for how long.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Well, I struggled a bit to write this review and I really wanted to give it 4 stars. But I couldn't in the end because I don't think that would be comparing ""Devil's Dream"" fairly to Bell's ""All Souls Rising"", a novel I find the richer and more moving of the two, and the novel to which I would attribute 4-5 stars.

""Devil's..."" is all in all a very entertaining, original and informative read. The story of Nathan Bedford Forrest is a truly fascinating one, and some of the literary tools Bell uses (i.e. the bits of ""magical realism"") add to that fascination . Some of the events in the first half of the novel regarding Forrest's family are powerfully done, e.g.the affairs Forrest had are described in a interesting, non-moralistic, human way; the death of his daughter is devastating..

But in the end, the constant chronological swings tired me. After loving the first 250 pages of the novel, I virtually flipped through the last 50. My sense was that what was described in those last pages had already happened earlier in the book (e.g. another horse shot dead from under Forrest after another heroic charge...). I had also grown tired at this point of trying to decipher Forrest's tennessee accent.

I remain an admirer of Smartt Bell. But ""All Souls Rising"" will provide readers a better experience of his talent"

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I purchased one of these at Wal-Mart for $10.00. In my 50's now I always wanted to have one. I don't know why some people had issues or put it down. First off I sent for the ants which cost another $5.00 for S&H right through the website. It took 10 days to receive them, keep in mind if you live somewhere it's cold or too hot you will wait longer. After receiving the ants, only one dead one, I followed the instructions closely. First making 4 starter tunnles with the tool and then cooling down the ants in the fridge for 15 minutes then putting them in. It took less the 24 hours and the ants started working. Each ant has different jobs. Some dig, some remove debris and some just stand guard near the lid. Someone reviewed it didn't light up well; maybe they didn't put batteries in it! Mine lighted up well! The only hard part to this is the fact you have to put the whole farm in the refrigerator for at least 75 minutes to slow the ants up to clean out the debris as they are very fast and will try to escape. I have it 3 weeks so far and lost maybe 5 ants as they do die off and do not lay eggs since there is no queen. Like any other creature sometimes they dig other times they rest.  I do believe its fun to watch and well worth the 10 bucks. I guess I'm a kid at heart, get one and enjoy the fun!"

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"My children enjoyed this game when they were in the 2 to 4 year old range. There's a little memory practice going on combined with color matching.

To play the game a bunch of cardboard fish are placed color side down in the center of the play area. Each player is given a plastic boat with 4 slots in it. Players use a plastic fishing pole with a suction cup on the end to pick up fish from the center. If the fish matches their boat's color the player gets to put the fish in his or her boat. If it doesn't match the color then the fish goes back into the center. This is where the memory aspect comes in. The other players need to remember where a fish was placed back in the center if it happened to be of their color. It doesn't take much memory to remember one fish location until your turn comes around, but this is really for the very youngest game players. The first player to fill their boat wins. There is a variant that lets it use the numbers on the colored fish to play the classic go fish game of making sets and asking other players for matches. This variant stretches the age appropriateness up to maybe 4 years old. The Go Fish game lost its appeal for my children once the youngest was 4. They moved on to more advanced memory games like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Magic-Labyrinth-Board-Game/dp/B003RDJYMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Magic Labyrinth Board Game</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hide-and-Eeek/dp/B003D7EPQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hide and Eeek</a>&nbsp;after that.

The pieces are colorful and attractive. The game lasted fine through a couple of years of use. The suction cup worked okay for us. The game would probably work fine in a preschool classroom.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I really like the games by this company (Gamewright). They have a whole series of short easy to play games and this is one of them. My four year old has been able to play this because it is easy and short and is over before his attention span is over. My eight year old has enjoyed this game and others like it by this company.

I'm not sure how educational it is, but I will say that it does help younger children with visual discrimination which is a prereading skill. Because this is a card game it is somewhat prone to being destroyed by young hands. However, the cards are larger than normal playing cards and very sturdy.

I would not hesitate to buy this game again. Enjoy."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I really wanted to love this camera.  But the noise levels and expensive lens selection wouldn't allow me to keep it.
I literally liked this camera so much I almost considered buying the meta bones speed booster adapter so I could use faster lenses from Nikon or Canon, but then I realized I'm getting into the higher end price range of cameras with much better sensors.  It was SO close, but not usable for me beyond a hobby camera.

With the poor battery life, had to buy lots of extra batteries. Seriously, if you want to film 4k video for wedding work you will need about ten batteries.
With poor noise / image quality (spend way too much time in post production)
With poor button layout (spend more time fiddling with buttons, less time taking pictures)

Pros:
- PRICE (wow at this price I would buy 3 of these)
- SIZE (fits in any bag)
- WEIGHT -- Light weight
- AUTO FOCUS -- Great auto focus
- STABILIZATION FOR PHOTOS -- Has Dual Stabilization for still photos (in camera + lens)
- COLOR -- Great color
- SCREEN -- tilts, swivel, touch screen, multi-touch. It's perfect!!
- Viewfinder -- best viewfinder I've ever used in my life!!!

Cons
- BUTTONS Physical button layout is terrible. (ISO, Shutter speed, F-stop should be together)
- STABILIZATION No Dual Stabilization for video (in camera + lens)
- BATTERY LIFE is horrible (you will need 3-4 batteries to compare to 1 DLSR battery)
- RAW FILES -- have to use Adobe DNG converter to edit raw files.  Very annoying."

Books_5,2.0,OR,"So, caveat of course - I did stop 1/3 of the way through the book, so it may well redeem itself later and come to a thrilling conclusion. I don't know, because I couldn't make it that far. Also, I think I missed one or more of the earlier books in this series. It seems like that might have been a prerequisite for liking the characters in this one, because none of them appealed to me. Mels, the heroine, was the most likeable but she still didn't grab me; she's stuck in a town she doesn't like and living with her mom and isn't doing anything about it. She's ""daring"" in that she doesn't wear a seatbelt, and nice in that she pays her debts and helps strangers in need, but that's about it. She's not striving for anything and has no greater plan of her own.

The hero and other male characters are all very JRWard-esque strong and uber-male and urban/gangsta, but not in a sexy way and again none of them really grabbed me. I wasn't rooting for anyone and wasn't worried about anyone. Unlike her Black Dagger Brotherhood series where the team is all about saving a community and innocents, in this series the cause (a fight between angels and demons) seems pretty self-centered. There may be some innocent caught in Hell that one of the angels is trying to rescue (again, must have missed that backstory in another book) but overall it seems the protagonists and antagonists are just trying to win a contest set up by the Maker in order to save their own souls.

Anyway - maybe if you read all the books in the series in order, and don't have any expectation of a good romance or quickly paced action, you'd enjoy it. I'll be skipping the rest of this series and waiting for her next."

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"I thought I would give this author and series a go with this book.  I have to say I was surprised that my attention was caught from the get go.

It was very interesting to see how Dominic spent the last 200 years buried at sea.  When he was 'resurrected' he was thrown into the future and struggled to catch up.  His friend Palo took him in and began teaching Dom how to survive in the new world he found himself in.

A few thing bugged me about this story.  The grammatical errors.  When Dom accused Palo as a 'trader'.  I think the word should have been 'traitor'.  So little things like that distracted me from the story a bit.

The author glossed over the transition period for Dom.  I felt that the book could have been much more detailed and the author could have had fun with Dom's struggle with the 21st century.  I realise the focus for Dom is revenge, but the writing could have been meatier and richer if the story went into a little more depth.

The sex described seemed to skip a few steps.  I won't go into detail in case there are under 18's reading, but there was no writing direction, the reader has to assume what happens and where the positions of the characters are.  There were instances where I had to re read passages to see if I missed some things.

In the synopsis Dominic is intrigued by a lady biker.  The only lady he showed an interest in was a mechanical bull rider at a bar he nearly got tossed out of!  So I wonder where and whom this lady is , cause I didn't meet her!

But it was a good start and I am definitely curious enough to get the second book!"

Books_5,5.0,OR,"In `Talk Before Sleep' Elizabeth Berg displays the dynamics of the female friendship in such a moving and realistic way that this could be a true story, only it's not.  Berg explains that she wrote the story to help sort out her experiences during her own friend's death, and this connection between herself and her characters keeps them real and alive.  You will not often find a book in which the characters so confidently propel the story forward.
Ruth is dying of caner, it's plain and simple.  Though she toys with the idea of `curing' herself, it's pretty apparent that she will be leaving her friends before she should have to.  But like so many of Berg's books, this story is really about  Ann, Ruth's maternally-inclined friend, who temporarily sacrifices her husband and daughter to care for Ruth in her home.  While Ann is waiting on Ruth hand and foot (emotionally, physically and medically) there is plenty of time for flashbacks that take the reader through the women's friendship; through divorces and children and all the messy stuff that life is made of.  While Ruth's other friends also play intricate parts in the story, the focus really is on Ann and what she will choose to retain from her friendship with Ruth and this phase of her life.
Even though the subject is somewhat grim, I enjoyed reading this book.  One thing that is always consistent in Berg's writing is that she doesn't skip over the less-attractive parts of the human nature, so when you're reading you find yourself easily relating to one or more of her characters.  Reading is so often such a solitary thing, but when it becomes interactive it stays with you."

The goal is to have a group of people who are going to be in a circle with the other players.  Each player has a different kind of magic that they use to bring down the other players.  Some of the magic works better than others, but I think it's a good way to mix things up.  I think the players are going to like it, and they're going to have fun playing this game.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"This book was in a word: adorable. Though perhaps not the most historically accurate portrayal of the medieval times, it was nonetheless a fun read and Im completely fine with that. (If anything, this was probably an idealistic version of history if women were actually given rights! :p) Rosemarie initially is a very tentative, if well-meaning, leader and its fantastic to see her grow into herself throughout the book. She may have been nave, but thats not completely unreasonable for someone who missed having her parents guidance and hadnt seen much outside her own lands. I would have liked to get to know the characters a little more, particularly the abbot. I didn't get the sense of completely knowing Rosemarie since a lot of the chapters from her perspective were general narration. That being said, this was a very short book and I think sacrificing getting to know some of the characters deeper was a reasonable tradeoff for a light quick read. Who should read it? Folks looking for a quick happily ever after. Please note: I received a free copy of this book in exchange of an honest review courtesy of the publisher. See all my reviews and more at www.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,CG,This is a great little tool. The only problem is that it takes a little getting used to.
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"This is a cute idea, but it's not all that much fun.
After the novelty wears off, there's not much to it.
This is a miniature race track with these cars that you charge up, then let zoom around for a few laps.  It's kind of neat.  These teeny tiny cars - seriously there are as big as my thumbnail, have batteries and motors in them.  The set needs two double-A batteries to work; and you ""charge"" up the little car, then let it go flying around the track.  It's a little klunky, but kind of neat.
Once the track is set, you place the car in the charging area and press a lever.  The lever sticks these two prongs into the back of the car.  The back of the car has 2 little metal pieces where the contact is made to charge the car.  Mine didn't work.  I had to fiddle with the wires in the back of the car but finally I was able to make contact.  When the car charges, it makes a little revving noise which is kind of neat.  Then you release the car, and it zooms around the track a few times.  It's cute.  It's also boring.  The novelty of one car wears off quickly.  This set claims you can race other cars, etc, but you only get one with this set.  Plus, it's not like you can make a bigger or different set with this one.  It's pretty limited in how you design or create a track.  If it came with two cars, you could ""race"" them etc, but alone, it's pretty dry stuff.
My nephews like to tear stuff up and re-design their own tracks but this is what it is - a single track.  At least it doesn't take up much space."
Electronics_5,5.0,CG,"This thing is well made and has the quality to it's specifications.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"STORY: Glenn Ford stars as the rancher Smith, who is driving his family to frustration with his gentle procrastinating ways that have kept the farm from doing well. The hay needs to be cut, and he is distracted with his ongoing friendships with a local Nez Perce Native American tribe. When a tribal member is wrongly accused of murder, Smith comes to his defense. As a sign of the tribe's gratitude, they help train a horse from the ranch, and they help get the hay crop in on time.

BEHIND THE SCENES: Live action Disney classic. Keenan Wynn, Nancy Olson, and Chief Dan George also star in this movie, and a good song written by Bobby Russell for the movie is featured, ""The Ballad of Smith and Gabriel Jimmyboy"". While production was started initially by James Algar, Bill Anderson took over as producer fairly early. One of the studios greatest producers, Anderson saw the fim as a chance to appeal to a more mature audience that a typical Disney film, vital to Disney's growth. Directed by Michael O'Herlihy. The story had been adapted by studio staff storyman Louis Pelletier from a book by Paul St. Pierre titled, ""Breaking Smith's Quarter Horse"". This movie was released to theaters on March 21, 1969, and was released on video in 1987. It never featured on ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" television show. It is 102 minutes in length.

Released almost two years after Walt's death, this film was almost unseen by the public since a top studio executive hated the film based on only a few scenes. He cut all funding for promotion of the film so there was no audience waiting to see it. Even a good review in the LA Times did not help bring the viewers in and it was out of theaters before the word of mouth could send in the crowds. I recommend this hidden little film from the Disney vault."

They look great on my sink and the color is just right.  They are easy to put together and I am very happy with them.  I'm happy with the color though.  I don't like that they are so small so I can't fit a large mug of coffee in them.  I'll probably have to order more of these to have a nice look on my sink.  I don't know if it will work in my bathroom but I'm sure I'll have a nice mug of coffee by the time I get home.  I love the color and feel of these and would definitely buy them again.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Quality hardware, and the quarter-turn valve works smoothly. One note of caution: this screws right into most faucets, but not all. If it doesn't fit, you need to buy a separate adapter for a few bucks. We actually changed faucets from a Kohler Alteo to a Dawn AB77 so this faucet diverter would work without an adapter.

The diverter's aerator works as well as the faucet's original aerator. And there are no leaks.

We got this diverter so we could use it to fill tropical fish aquariums BTW--not the use most people would make of it to be sure, but very handy if that's what you need.

Note that it looks good enough so that we just leave it on the faucet. If you're going to do this, though, you'll probably need a ""high arc"" faucet--otherwise the spout's too low."

You can make it tighter but I don't want to over do it. ... Will likely wear this while lifting weights as well.

They were easy to install and when used in conjunction with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blum-Universal-Mounting-Bracket/dp/B002K9TAN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blum Universal Mounting Bracket</a>&nbsp;i was easily able to mount them to the base of my 1\2 plywood shelves. The super tricky part with these was to be able to get them lined up so that you don't have to move them to much. We reversed the mount so that it was under the drawer so that we could have a full width drawer in the cabinet. They slide really smooth and extend all the way with no issues. They also lock  back into place which is very nice to have.

Pro's
 100lbs capacity, they will be able to hold almost anything you can put on them
 Many different lengths, this review is for the 16 inch, but they have many sizes
 Super easy to install, just some screws and off you go

Con's
 If you using them with the bottom mount adapters we had to make our own hole for one of them, but worked out
 Can be annoying to line up and make sure they are level
 Gets your hands a little greasy if you mess with them a lot

Conclusion
For an overall project these are great. easy to work with and heavy duty. Take your time when installing them to make sure they line up and are level. Completely worth the price."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,CG,"Want to know the bane of an electric car?  I will say that it's a pretty good electric car.  The motor is solid and takes the guesswork out of how much power it needs.  It does a good job of pulling the fuel out of the car and does a great job of avoiding the nasty gas smells that can occur in the car.  It also has a nice height knob that adjusts the height of the car.  I like that the car has a motor that is adjustable from about 1,000 to about 1,000 watts.  That is a big plus.  I am happy with the car because it has a nice weight to it.  The only downside I have is that I don't like the ""gift"" feature.  I wanted something that would be easier to use and I thought the gift feature was a good feature.  I gave it to my friend and she loved it.  It is very cute and I really like that it has a drawstring that can be used to hang it on the wall.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a very strong, compact"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Review is based on only one use in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, at the Eben Ice Caves.

These cleats work very good on the ice.

Sizing is just right: I purchased a Large, for a size 10.5 men's winter hiking boot. Easy to put on, even outside in the cold. Fit great.

I also purchased a pair of ""Crampon Ice Traction Cleats by Rover Adventure Gear"", in a size Medium. They did NOT fit my boots, but they fit my niece's size 8 woman's winter boot just fine.

The Hillsound cleats are much better quality - the chain is stainless steel instead of basic steel that rusts, and the rubber is thicker and more elastic. But they also cost twice as much.

I did not give these 5 stars because I feel they are a bit over-priced, and they didn't come with a pouch, which the cheaper ones did."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I really thought this game looked silly at first - but once I got to playing it, it's amazingly fun! You get All Three new Episodes of the movies with this game!

The little lego guys are absolutely adorable, and when ships blow up, they disintegrate into their component lego parts. Lego fans will be thrilled to see little lego flowers, lego swinging doors, and much more. The game is pretty true to the story line, which is funny in and of itself, watching the famous Star Wars scene done lego-style. You jump, shoot and light-saber your way through the scenes. You get to use a variety of characters, and each character of course has his or her own special talents. There's a lot of coin-collecting, secret-finding and bad guy bashing. There's an optional two player mode which is great - someone else can grab a controller, play for a while, then drop out without any penalty at all. There's a regular story mode for going through the movie plotline, plus a free play where you can randomly switch between various players to solve some of the trickier puzzles. There's a good deal of replayability as you go back searching for the treasures, and trying to unlock all of the cool extra features. This is really perfect for the munchkins, but adults may find themselves playing it after the little ones are asleep because it's actually rather fun. I was impressed with the graphics too - the little legos walk as you might imagine they would, the floors shine with great reflections, the textures are just very nice. There isn't much sound besides the Star Wars themes going on in the background :)

I didn't have any problems with crashes at all, and if I ever do get bored with it, there's a line of people waiting to get it from me next."

I'm a big fan of the YA books, and this one was a novella!  I love the characters, and this was no different!

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"It isn't easy for Zac, coming of age in a small Missouri town in the 1960s. People think hes slow. Thats not true, but he would rather they thought that than know the truth. While the other boys are discovering the charms of the opposite sex, Zac realizes he has it bad for a slightly older neighbor boy, Rory. Zac escapes into his own world of drawings and fantasies.

Art of the Heart is a bittersweet coming of age story. In just a few pages, the author captures the pathos of growing up in a small town knowing you're different than everyone else, and dealing with that first crush which is made tougher by being unrequited.

Dont be fooled by the subject or plot into thinking this is some sappy Young Adult (YA) story. Art of the Heart is a story mature adults will probably relate to more than teens or twenty-somethings. The effects of first love can only really be appreciated from some distance. Theres a maturity to the story that belies the plot line, which is not to say the characters are unbelievable. In fact, they seem quite real. Its just that they are drawn from a perspective one doesnt often see in stories about young people."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"These gloves fit really snug (Medium). I had tried some on at a local shop in Large, which I knew would be too big (baggy in the fingertips). I also took the advice of another rider who reminded me that most gloves stretch a bit over time. Despite being tough to get on and off, they didn't bind and were very comfortable when riding my recumbent or my upright.

I had hoped they'd be a little warmer, but overall I still like them.

Only real complaints:

--The velcro strap at the wrists is small and looks flimsy. I can see this breaking in the future. On the upside, they are so snug and have a little bit of a ""cuff"" so even if the strap breaks the gloves would be perfectly functional (the strap is almost superfluous).

--I would have expected a longer cuff towards the wrists for a winter-intended glove, and one they advertise as water resistant. Getting a jacket over the cuff really won't work very well: isn't long enough and no real edge to keep the jacket cuff from riding up your arm. Thankfully, I have dedicated rain gloves for wet riding.

UPDATE 3/21/17: downgraded from 4 stars to 3
The outside of the index finger on the gloves is wearing through, especially the right glove. I assume this is because of shifting or perhaps some other abrasion? It may seem harsh to downgrade from 4 to 3 stars after a little over 3 years of daily use for 6 months a year, but there was a time when even inexpensive cycling gloves would last many more years than this, so it's a bit of a disappointment.

I will likely not buy again, might see what Giro has to offer (since I like their Zero gloves for the summer)."

Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"This dollhouse is a complete pain to put together alone. It would have been a much easier job with 2. Think awkward two finger screwdriver holding while suspending a floor with the same hand and using a tiny allen wrench with the other hand. I only had one hole that had poor pre-drilling, so compared to some of the other reviewers, I felt lucky. After the 2 1/2 hour construction, it seems like it will be a nice dollhouse. It seems good and sturdy. The ramp for the garage will likely fall off regularly because of the way it attaches, but its not really a essential element anyway.

Update
3 months later... I am leaving the three star rating.  The garage door ramp has never fallen off like I expected that it would, it doesn't attach very strongly, but the house doesn't get moved around all that much either. My son loves this house, and its played with daily. No amount of adjustments ever made our elevator work smoothly. It got stuck all the time, and I removed it entirely. It was bulky, awkward, and impossible for my independent 2 1/2 year to operate on his own. Luckily we have a super handy grandpa, who whipped up some nice ladders with some scrap wood and dowels, and my son has been much happier.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"This is a comparison of 3 travel mugs I own: Contigo Snapseal, Contigo Autoseal, Thermos King.  I only use for hot coffee.

Temperature:  The Autoseal is king hereit holds the temperature ridiculously well, due to the combination of the lock on top and the finger button on the side.  Its a clear 5 stars.  King is second, with Snapseal right behind the King.

Size: The Snapseal holds more, without being cumbersome, so if the 20vs16 is important to you, this is a bonus.  The King is better than the Autoseal for one reason to me- it fits under the 3 Keurigs I regularly use.

Use:  The King is indeed king herethe slide switch is easy, and the deeper lid means spills are captured easily.  Also, you can slide it open and then drink at your leisure, without holding a button downand it comes in handle and non-handle versions.  The Snapseal is a 4 star herefor the first 1/3 of the cup, its smooth, but after that, it tends to spill a little, and no button required here either (plus it has a nice side grip).  The Autoseal is a 2-star herethere is almost no room for spillback, and you have to push in a button every time to release a liquid (hence why it probably keeps liquids hotter).

Cleaning:  All are pretty easy to clean, although I get the best warm-and-fuzzy from the Autoseal, since the bottom part snaps loose on a hinge to allow the suds to get into more parts.

Bottom line- if temperature is your thing, and you're ok with a button and some small spills, go with Autoseal.  If fitting under a Keurig and a good balance of temperature and use are your thing, go with Snapseal.  If ease of drinking with good temperature control is your thing, go with the King.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"These shoes appear to have been discontinued by the maker, so I didn't take any chances.  Bought these as a back-up pair for when I've outworn my current pair.  These shoes go with everything.  The pewter color makes them versatile for dressing up or going casual; wearing with gold or silver accessories.  Since it is a Naturalizer brand they are well made and extremely comfortable for walking or standing long hours.  I'm also guilty of wearing them without socks or pantyhose, so I like that they do not make me feet sweat.  The slight heel is perfect for me since I cannot wear ballet flat shoes and don't always want to wear heel for a dressier look."

I have read a few of her books and she has always made me laugh and cry. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because I was hoping for more from this author. I liked the ending and she did a great job of showing us the world we live in. I have been reading some of her other books and they all had great twists and turns. I hope she continues to write better. I've read all of the 3 books by this author. I have no idea how to rate them. I don't really know how to rate the 4 of them. So far I have not gotten into them.

Electronics_5,5.0,CG,"On my Nikon D5300 with a lens hood and a hooded lens hood, I noticed that the front edge of the lens hood was a bit softer than the hooded lens hood. This is because the hooded lens hood is designed to allow for better light and better sharpness. The hooded lens hood is also designed to provide a better grip on the lens.

I also noticed that my lens hood was not able to hold the lens in the case that I was holding. This was due to the lens hood not having enough space for the lens hood.

I was able to remove the hood from the lens hood and place it in the case."

This Pachmayr recoil pad is only 4.600 inches tall, and the original pad on my new 1895 is about 4.730 inches tall. The Pachmayr pad is sized so that you can cut about 1/2 inch off the stock and install the new butt pad with no change to the length of pull.

I use it for my high impact classes like Body Combat and even Zumba, it just performs beautifully. It's been awhile that Asics has come out with a great cross trainer like this.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"At first I thought there was something wrong with this game.  After a couple minutes I realized the game can sense your hand movement behind the buttons also.  The trick is to not move the hand that you are holding it with or it will read a touch.  The game is so sensitive it can read your hand just hovering above the touch panels, and quite accurately.  After learning the trick I like it very much because you can light up the pattern much quicker than the old games.  The slide game works quite well.
The only thing about this game is wasn't crazy about is that I like classic Simon and the game will only use the left side of each color, pressing the other side will result in a buzz and lost game.
Overall I would say the the game is an improvement over the old hard press Simon games."

Most dough would stick to it if you do not use flour (good for some doughs).  Also, it's slightly non-stick nature means you do not have to use too much flour for rolling. The mat sticks to the surface of the counter as long as the surface is clean and smooth. So, no problem with that. It is very thin and light not bulky. And it folds up easily for proper storage.

I loved it and am glad I read it. I read it every other week."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Lauren Oliver is a powerful writer whose prose punches the reader in the gut while creating empathy for the characters and building suspense. Panic does this in spades. It has a desperate, pessimistic, chilling tone that reflects the feelings of the main characters. Heather, Dodge, Natalie and Bishop know there is only a bleak future for them if they stay in their small rural dead-end town, but too poor for college and with no money to move, they have no way to escape. Participating in The Panic, a perilous and potentially deadly series of dares, offers a minuscule chance at winning a pool of money large enough to start a new life somewhere else. The very realistic characters are portrayed as flawed and sincere teens. They are rash and narcissistic, but loyal to a fault when it comes to looking out for the ones they love. Each has a different motive for participating, different plans for the money, and the determination of a mother grizzly. None of the teens is likable all the time, but none is despicable, either. The reader feels their deep unhappiness and hopes each will find some joy and optimism."

He's not on the approved list but Seraphina knows him well.  While waiting for approval, he has his sights set on hot, older teacher, Olivia.  She has such a visceral reaction to him and she doesn't know why, seeing as he appears much younger than she.  He notices her reluctance but feels drawn to her.  I won't give away any more of the story but it takes a turn you are so not expecting.  Truly enjoyed this short read so much that it felt like a full book!

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"Overall, this is a cheesy, predictable, but cute little romance/chick lit.

It's one of those books where the reader can figure out the general plot within a few pages. There are no surprises here! That said, other than the main character's total inability to figure out her flatmate's motives, these are likeable characters (Josh is practically saintly, which stretches suspension of belief to an extreme) and it's a fun, if rather far-fetched, plot.

However, it could so easily have been a good deal better. Romantic comedies, be they in films or books, are generally thoroughly predictable, but there's foreshadowing and then there's LOOK THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. A touch more subtlety would not have gone amiss! It is at least fairly short, or the plot would get even more contrived.

On top of that, it needs a good proofread to weed out the careless mistakes. Lots of capitalisation of speech tags, words missing out, misused/typo'd words (were for wear, for example), etc. Generally I don't expect perfection from self-pubbed efforts, but I do expect the writer to take a little more time to fix basic, easily corrected errors like this.

So... reasonably engaging characters, and the book is entertaining enough (with at least one laugh-out-loud moment), but if I'd paid list price for it, I'd feel pretty short-changed."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"No issue with the merchant - ClothingShopOnline shipped the item promptly and it was clearly brand-new - but I buy these extra-huge sizes to allow for the inevitable shrinkage in the wash.  I'm not a massive guy, just taller than most...and my goal is to start out with something closer to the size of a tent, and end up with something that fits after it's been washed.  So I tried this XXXL sweatshirt on and while it was good and roomy and baggy (as expected, remember, I want that extra room so that when it shrinks it'll be fine), the sleeves were just a hair longer than what would have been expected from an XL.  So right now, unwashed and right out of the box, the sleeve length is basically perfect.  Which means, once washed, these sleeves will be far too short.  Actually, I bet these *are* sleeves for an XL shirt; the seam at the shoulder is almost down to my bicep, meaning they added material in the torso area but not in the sleeves.  I have to laugh - what kind of individual must the manufacturer have been envisioning when determining what XXXL should be?  Maybe a three-foot-tall troll with little nubs for arms?  I'll probably keep it and just wash it in cold (and air dry it)...since the weight is nice and it seems to be of decent enough quality."

Books_5,2.0,OR,"Totally not what I expected from this prequel/sequel.  The writing did not flow for me and I struggled to keep the characters all separate and identify who was who and what was what.  A bit of a weak reasoning behind what ""caused"" Hannibal to be Hannibal the Cannibal.  In fact, I felt there was a big contradiction in the explanation as Hannibal was so disgusted by the Cannibalism that went on during the war (ok it was his sister they ate) that I did not truly believe that he would resort to it himself.

I am left wanting a further book to bridge the significant gap between this one and the rest of the Hannibal Lector books.

I prefer this one over the shorter version (16 ft) because it gives more freedom for my dog to wander around in places where he can't (unfortunately) be unleashed. I use the leash with a 22 lbs Lhasa Apso and am very satisfied. The only downside is that it's a little bit heavier than the shorter version - nothing that bothers tough."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I had this trasmitter for 2 years. It outperformed my firends and families transmitters by being compact, no cords unless you want to charge it. The transmitting wire is on the outside which gives it a stronger signal even though it runs off the Ipods power. The only drawback is that....it runs off the Ipods power and drains it after a good day of driving, unless you plug it in to a mini USB port cigarette lighter power thingy which you can grab at radio shack. I had to buy another one because I pulled the wire out of it not realizing it was the transmitter cable......not my brightest moment. But just press play and within 4-5 feet of my radio I had crystal clear music with NO STATIC. I could pass it around my car without interruption and people could play what they liked. Excellent product, don't tear the transmitting wire out!"

Hi-cool are far superior. I wear them for at least 8 hours and my arms do not mind! I am afraid of skin cancer and I am in the sun all day, so I bought these. Yes, they are bit warm, but not bad at all. They grip but not so tight you lose circulation (and I do not have skinny arms). They are so soft and comfortable. I wish I knew what the other ones were called, but I now know for a fact that Hi-Cool Rules!

06/2015-  Well, I ordered another pair and these are different. They are much thinner and seem shorter. I guess they are not all made the same. Just a heads up. The new pair is very uncomfortable because it is smaller and shorter.  Once you stretch it to fit, you can see through the fabric....hope it still protects me.  Buyer beware.

I just thought this was an excellent film. As a low budget indie you couldn't ask for anything more. If there was a few million behind it, and some stars in the main roles, this film could be a blockbuster.

Why? Because it's credible. A few years from now, something like this WILL be happening, as AI influences people, AI becomes as real as real people, and it has the chance to become all powerful.

I have bamboo cutting boards and since I know bamboo stands up well to water, this was an easy purchase for me. It does not fit over my soaking tub and isn't adjustable, but fits in my standard tub in my guest bath. It gives the guest bath a spa-type feel. It can be used on a dresser or counter top in addition to the tub. It's spacious and securely holds wine glasses. If this had rubber grips for on the edge of the tub, I'd rate it 5 stars, but overall I really like it."

It is too short to connect the display but easily connects to the DVI-D cable I already had for my flatscreen monitor.

I would have given it five stars if it weren't so expensive - it seems overpriced for how simple it is, but others were even more so what can I say? Apple owners might be used to paying extra but as a PC user I was surprised at the high price. It does the trick though and was worth it to get dual monitors working!"

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Actually, having attended a number of academic conferences myself, I am not sure this is a satire. Quite a few of the ""fictitious"" presentations in this book sported titles (and contents) that were uncomfortably familiar. (What can I say? I was young...I didn't know any better...)  As for the back-biting, infighting, petty scheming, feuds, and general unmitigated nastiness--it's all too true. Fortunately, in Lodge's hands, it's also funny enough to take the sting out of some of the more pointed barbs.

And, if Lodge's lampoon of academia isn't enough to tickle your funny bone, you'll surely get a laugh out of the misguided kidnapping, adultery, unrequited love, requited love, strippers, porn, a journey around the world, and one of the most hilarious scenes in print (a karaoke bar in Tokyo that was definitely lost in translation).

Lodge's writing is a pleasure to read. He is clever (without being precious), ironic, poignant, even lyrical in places. As befitting a novel about literary criticism, there are references to everyone we know and love: Shakespeare (All's Well That Ends Well), Oscar Wilde (The Importance of Being Ernest--the twins are found in a Gladstone bag), and, naturally, the Grail Quest with all of its incumbent post-modernist/feminist permutations. I was thoroughly delighted to see that Lodge even referenced himself. (On page 280 Angelica's father bemoans the ignorance about identical twins. He mentions that he ""didn't have the patience"" to read a novel which featured identical twins of opposite sexes. The novel was David Lodge's ""Changing Places."")

You will find this book gut-wrenchingly funny if you are in academia.  If you are not, well, just enjoy your flight."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Today, almost everyone has heard of Billy Graham, but not everybody knows his early history--or ""the rest of the story"", as Paul Harvey liked to say.  This DVD tells the rest of that story, and it was very interesting.

The narrative begins with Billy Graham as a young man living at his parent's home, and how he came to be called into the ministry.  We also learn about the person he almost married, and the one he did--and how he met her.  We see how one of Billy Graham's very best friends in the ministry lets him down, and then ridicules him publicly.  It is very easy to identify with Billy Graham in the different situations portrayed.

This movie definitely keeps your interest, some parts are funny and some are sad.  Even if Billy Graham were not a public figure, this would be an account worth watching.  Even though there were not any big name actors in this film, it was well done and enjoyable.  I am a long-time admirer of Dr. Graham, and came forward at one of his crusades when I was twelve years old.  Learning Dr. Graham's history made me respect him even more.

The movie is suitable for all ages and clean.  Our family highly recommends this, and gives it five stars."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"It is official: vampires are so last year. Kate's Fallen helps lead the way in this new angelic revolution. Novels such as Fallen will easily do for angels what the Twilight series did for vampires.

Fallen was almost exactly what I was hoping it would be. It was dark, romance, and had tons of unexpected plot twists that had me gasping. While there is some room for improvement with the pacing of the novel, the overall premise was amazingly creative. It features a wonderful blend of religious ideals with Kate's fictitious world. Kate has a wonderful way of pulling the reader into the world of Sword & Cross. I constantly found myself thinking I had only read about five pages, only to discover it was closer to twenty. This is due in part to how well Kate explores the world she has created. Every detail has been thought of, and is explained beautifully.

But by far, my favorite aspect has to be the characters. Luce is an interesting heroine. I am really interested to see how she develops since there is a lot of potential with her. And I can't wait to see more of her and Daniel. They are an interesting pair to say the least. While I love those two, it is Cam that really has my attention. He is an alluring mixture of good and evil. I am dying to learn more about him, and his overall role in the plot. In regards to secondary characters, Kate has created some of my favorites of all time, with Penn leading the way. They are funny, creative, and above all else, memorable.

Despite certain plot issues that need to be addresses, I have to say that I am pleased with this novel. It was highly creative, and left me wanting to know me. I can't wait to see what twists await me in the next book."

This is - without a doubt - the WORST book I have read in years. Maybe the worst book I have ever read. I can't put this into words. The plot is unbelievably bad. The character development is terrible. The writing is cliche riddled and awful. As I reached the climatic scene, the culmination of the most bizarre set of coincidences in the history of ""literature"", I was laughing out loud at the absurdity of the plot. What a waste of time."

Unfortunately the maker states more compatibility than it really has. I can get some games to kinda work and others don't work with it at all. It says there is tons of games on the market it is compatible with but only shows me 20 and I don't own any of them. I am currently trying it with other controller programs and some of them could work it better than Nyko's own program which is frankly sad.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"This is a very good book that deals with problems a lot of kids have, such as being picked on and left out, even if the main focus was fantasy.  Being an avid reader of fantasy, I have read all the old cleshaes, but this book was in a league all it's own.  The story is about thirteen year old Nita, who goes into a library to hide from bullies, and comes across a training book on  how to be a wizard.  After reading through it, she discovers that she has many of the qualifications, so she decides to give it a shot, though she suspects some sort of prank.  In her exploriations, she meets up with Kit, a twelve year old boy in basicly the same situation as her, and they decide to team up and  be partner wizards.  As I read this book, I found myself likeing it more and more, as I enjoyed the sense of magic, and identified  strongly with the main character.  Though some of the magic spells they were doing got a little bit tedious, the book was generaly very exiting and well written with somewhat of a sad ending."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"Love, Lucy was a great book that I read along with my friends. There is travel, romance, college life, and self-discovery. I liked seeing Italy through Lucy's eyes and falling in ""something"" with Jesse Palladino. He definitely is crush-worthy.

One of my favorite terms from Love, Lucy was ""vacation flirtation"" - referring to the quick romance you experience while on vacation. This sounds like something my best friend and I would have termed.

I liked this story so much. There were times that I wanted more development, more answers to questions that I had about secondary characters, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Five Things I Want to Do After Reading Love, Lucy

  1. Travel abroad. This is a given. Grab a backpack and go!
  2. Watch Roman Holiday. Lucy mentions it a few times and recreates a scene for a picture. I've never seen it and now I want to.
  3. Read A Room with a View by E.M. Forster. Love, Lucy is an adaptation
  4. Watch a live musical. Or maybe just sing along loudly to a musical soundtrack.
  5. Read more books by April Lindner."
Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"This GPS served me fairly well (although my first update seemed to mess up its routing) for three years.  It routed in basic fashion, and did not surprise me too much.  The selection to favor back roads was especially good, and the POIs were quite extensive. Then I was recently ready to go on a long trip through the southern US and up the east coast. I was packed, turned it on and then NOTHING but the Magellan intro screen hanging there. System reset did not fix anything, and then it turned itself off.  In short, this a defective unit after three years of only occasional use. I stopped at a Walmart on the way of my trip and chose a TomTom Start 40M, which is a very nice unit that was up and running in 5 minutes. A bit quirkier than the Magellan, POIs are not as good, but it is quite smart in its routing. I expect electronics to last a lot more than three years. No wonder there are so many refurbished 1412s out there! One star ONLY for lack of durability, but that is BIG."

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"A cute little plush critter with a biiig mouth a happy grin, and a real Elmo voice (just like on Sesame Street)  -- this Gund Nursery Rhyme Elmo Sound Toy ...  is endearing and cute to look at --- as he sits there, book in hand, big grin on mouth. Flick the switch on his tusch, squeeze his left foot and Elmo reads you a Cute Little Poem, one of 5. ""Do you want Elmo to read you ANOTHER poem?"" he then says -- Well, It took us a while to realize that Shouting ""YES!!! "" was not the way to hear another poem (LOL) but SQUEEZING his left foot IS the way to entice him to recite them, one at a (foot squeeze) time. His diction is FLAWLESS. He also makes cute and pertinent comments about each poem, which is delightful to adult and child. Kids can recite the poem(s) with him. (if you don't want to hear another poem Elmo apologetically says ""OK Maybe Later, Bye Bye!""

The book he is holding has drawings on it that illustrate the poems -- ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"", ""Humpty Dumpty"", ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"". ""The Itsy Bitsy Spider"", and Hickory Dickory Dock"". All of this is CUUUTE. So is Nursery Rhyme Elmo. Cute, with floppy little fuzzy legs, but not totally cuddly as his inner workings and his mouth are made of Hard Stuff and he has a hard butt -- so, carrying him around would be fun for a kid, but I doubt close-cuddling would be very enticing.

However, this is a cuuute toy and each poem invites dialogue and the use of imagination between parent and kid or between siblings ."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is genuine adult fantasy at its finest. I don't mean it is pornographic, though there are sexual elements presented within reason. What I mean is that Bakker does not try to beat around the bush here. His characters are flawed, in fact here perfection is defined as the ability to manipulate others. The most likable characters are often the weak ones, but it is in fact this weakness that gives them compassion for others. There are no definite good guys, even those seeking to battle against the apocalypse are suspect. After all, if you are fighting for such a worthy cause isn't any evil excusable?

And if all men and women are manipulated by their emotions, their past experiences, is it really a crime to use them or hurt them? Are they not machines? These are the questions Bakker poses in the course of the novel, which is filled with political intrigue, military conquest, and realistic love stories. What I mean by realistic is that there are no virgin princesses, no knights in shining armor, but rather imperfect people loving each other. This is definitely one of the more honest fantasies that has come down the pipe in quite some time."

Unlike so many other reviewers on this page, I found it to be dull and mechanical, a by-the-numbers production with a clunky and unappealing robot at its center, filled with stock characters that do and say exactly what you think they will because you've seen it all a million times before.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"I purchased these gloves thinking they would be a good way to combat the relatively mild winters we experience here in central New Mexico. It's true, they are better than nothing, but they offer no protection against water and very little protection against wind, and are only meagerly insulated; I would feel my hands getting extremely cold after only a few minutes in 35-45 degree weather. I would also call durability into question because the fabric they are made from has started pilling after only a few weeks of use and the strap holding the retaining clasp on one of the gloves snapped right off while pulling them out of my back pocket. Again, these gloves are certainly better than nothing, but are near useless if used around water, snow, or ice, and are certainly not useful for use around freezing temperatures. These are almost certainly more suitable for use a a liner for a heavier glove or mitten than as a standalone unit and I would recommend using it as such."

The movie takes place in the future in a large city, and the characters are human. The movie also has a lot of nudity, and most of the nudity is made on the female side. The movie is quite graphic and I found myself thinking that the sex scenes were a bit graphic, but that it was done to be a bit more sexual."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"After reading every review on deep fryers I could find, I finally decided on this one.  It has been great and I couldn't ask for anything better or more easy to use.

I put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors.  It heats up quickly and the food has always come out great.  We made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross-odors or tastes!  My family only tolerates fish, so this was greatly appreciated.

Cleanup is easy also.  After waiting for the oil to cool, the pan, lid and rack can go into the dishwasher.  Only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy.  The oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than I originally thought it would be.

I would recommend this with no caveats."

Set the timer for it to electrically cook rice then do the garden and lawn maintenance. How they managed to engineer this tiny thing to do it all is beyond me. If they had put half as much effort into writing the verbiage for this unit we would all be blown away.
Just plug it in, throw some rice and a splash of water, press the button and BOOM! the lawn and garden is perfectly maintained! Who would have thought this could all be done with a rice cooker?!

The controls are simple but do lots. After taking each photo he loves to go to the wall and show off what he has done. the photos that turn in to mini movies are the best and have him laughing every time.

That said, don't fool yourself into trying to use it as a tiny home theater projector like I did, though. The native resolution is a disappointing 480p, and the digital upscaling looks very grainy, at least with a PS4 driving it. Also, the focus wheel is easily moved, even by vibrations from being mounted on the same wall as the speakers, so it loses focus pretty easily.

All in all, I'll probably be getting another projector for the media room and using this one for presentations and such when I'm on the road."

The author has a way of painting the picture of a typical military situation, and the cover of this book is a bit confusing. It's clear that the author is writing as a civilian, and the military is not a military organization. I guess it's a military-specific perspective, since the military is not a military organization. The military organization is a separate entity, and it is not very interested in what it is doing, and how it is doing it. There is no direct relationship between the military and the civilian, and the book is mostly about the military's attitude toward the civilian.

As a chemist, I do find the ""silver ion"" coating quite cool as its antimicrobial action really does work to keep the towel from smelling musty.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Most readers of John Le Carre know him for his more publicized stories; not as many have read back to the beginning.  I started as many readers with the more modern day stories and then I went back and read the famous, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.  Comparing the earlier Le Carre to the later day author is night and day.  So I decided to start at the beginning - Call for the Dead.

George Smiley is introduced to us in this book.  He is not the supreme spymaster at this point that he becomes later.  Some may argue this point, as his storied heroics from WWII are on display.  But he is not so confident of his skills or his governmental position.  His personal strife with the divorce of his wife Ann is described and this adds to his personality.  Smiley is not the king of the Secret World at this point and his inexperience is fun to see.

The story is very short on pages, but not on important developments.  At this stage of Le Carre's career, he could say much with few words.  The characters are surprisingly well developed in 128 pages.  The intricacies of the storyline are well thought out and the ending, if not totally surprising, is explained in detail - something that doesn't happen so often in Le Carre's later writings.

I found myself wired in to this story for no other reason that I felt I was watching the manifestations of some of the most famous spy characters in history - Mundt and Smiley.  I can't say that the story is so twisted that the reader can't figure it out, but I will say that the writing is so well done, that you can't help but read every word.  The reader can begin to see the mind of Le Carre as he takes a simple plotline and attempts to weave it a myriad of ways.

If you've liked the later books, treat yourself to this one - the creation."

I love how it all started. I have read many of the books in the series and have never read any of them. This was a very good book. I would recommend it.

My only complaint is I am not sure how this author will handle the story line. I think that it will be"

It's a good size, very comfortable.I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He's a huge fan of the sneaker and it fits him so well.  He says it's very comfortable and he's wearing it all the time.  I got the black and it is exactly what I wanted.  I've only worn it twice, but I"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Just started taking yoga at our company-offered class.  All new props were purchased for this class and all items--8' straps, bolsters, blocks, mats, and blankets--were Hugger Mugger brand.  The instructor said this brand was always good quality.  For my home practice I also got this blanket.  It is soft yet sturdy, has that broken-in look that I didn't mind throwing on the floor, and I can fold it just like in class.  It washed up nice too.  Kinda wanted to pick a color, but I received the black/gray one and I LOVE it.  I never would have picked it but it really looks great!  Also, when I purchased this same blanket mid September it was $24.99."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"This product is exactly what it is and the materials are good.  I have a large one and a small one.  I am using this for the shoulders, chest, and back.  It is great for those of us who do not have long arms.  If you have short arms, this is a good product.  I can't wait to use it.I love this gun. It does what it's supposed to do. It's easy to shoot and easy to conceal. I've shot about 1,000 rounds in it, and it's actually not bad. It's super light and easy to carry. It's a good price. I'm not a big fan of the price, but I'm happy to say that I'm using it for a few rounds at a time.I love this little bag. I have a small tent and my wife and I have both had camping trips with this thing. It's a great tent. It's very light weight and easy to carry. I like the fact that it is smaller than the standard lightweight bag. The zipper is a little small for my purposes, but it's easy to close and close. The bag has a small zipper that is easy to open and close. The zipper is also a little loose and not very secure. The zipper is very easy to open and close and there are two pockets inside. The pack itself is very comfortable and well made."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,CG,"It took me 8 years to assemble the pieces, and I'm still happy with the finish. The finish is not the best I've seen, but the plastic is solid and it's nice to have a little bit of paint on it. I wish it was a bit thicker, but it's a nice finish for the price. I'm very happy with it.I've had this for about a year now and I love it!  The color is great and the very soft feel makes it very comfortable to sleep on.  The only issue I have is that the coffee is still a little too hot and the cup is still cold when it's done.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to take a chance on a coffee mug.  I also like that the top is a little smaller than the bottom, but that's the best feature of this mug.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Excellent device.  Checked it vs my multimeter and was almost dead on.  I used it to check my refrigerator kWh.  What an eye opener.  Next I'll be looking for a new refrigerator.  My refrigerator should be using about 715 kWh per year.  Mine is using about 1550kwh per year.  Guess it is getting near end of its life.  Having said all that.  This meter is awesome and does what it says it does......
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,CG,My son is a huge fan of the movie and this is a nice addition to the collection. Great product. Great price! I am a huge fan of Tootlemania and this is by far my favorite. Highly recommend. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"This would be great if I wasn't going to be home and wanted lights going on and off at various times during the day and night. But what I want to use it for is to run a water distiller for exactly 5 hrs. The other type of timer was not accurate. This one is, but each time I want to run it, I have to set the time to go on and then off and verify the day and the schedule. The next day always at a different time than the previous day, when I want to run the distiller for five hours, I have to set the timer again as to what time it should go on and then off and also set the day for it to run and whether it should repeat everyday, every other day etc...all settings that are insignificant to me.

I wish I could just set to run for five hours and have it turn off afterwards. It was a lot of money to pay for for what I needed: a simpler setup. I am sure it is great for turning lights on and off randomly, as it says it does.

I have it plugged in an outlet under a wall cabinet which has a light under it but I have to use a flashlight to view the digital screen. It protrudes beyond where the light can shine on it.

When setting the times, if you go past the number you wanted, you cannot reverse it, but have to go all the way around the 12 hrs to get back to the number you wanted. This goes for hours and minutes, days of the week etc, for each of the on and off settings. Kind of a hassle. Anyone know of a simpler timer?"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"First: I don't like to give anything away about the stories.

The Bombay's are a family of assassins and have been for the past 4000 yrs or so. If you are a blood relative, then you will become an assassin or die. If you marry into the family, male or female, you must change your last name to Bombay.  The children are all named after countries, states, cities, etc. The cousins that we read about are fun and funny.  Despite being assassins, they live normal lives, just like the rest of us, except for the rather large trust funds that each has.  The assassin business has paid well over the years.  They find themselves in precarious situations, and the fun begins. Despite the sometimes poor editing, I enjoy these books a lot. I tend to pick them up and read the next when I need a good laugh."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I am so pleased with the ODOR Absorbed Activated Charcoal NATURAL Deodorizer Bag by UBERPAKK. In the past the only option I thought I had was placing one of those charcoal tubs in my bathroom or closet which works pretty well but doesn't look nice at all. This will eliminate the odors and yet be non-imposing on my decor or be forgotten in my closet.

I put one of these right smack dab on the top of the tank of my toilet of my guest bathroom which is only used when we have guests. It goes great in there and also looks very decorative. (So much better than having the charcoal tub sitting on the floor). I put the other one in a guest room closet. I really hate going in one of my rooms, opening up a closet and it smelling musty. Now, it never will. I hung it on a hanger and it can be seen by anyone who hangs their clothes in there. It just looks nice. The muted green goes with any room in my house so I am certain that I will be ordering more before too long.

I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST & UNBIASED opinion. I ALWAYS pretest every product prior to writing a review. I am free to write whatever I believe to be true, whether positive or negative. This is my true story and my honest opinion."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Couldnt put this one down from start to finish! From page one Ms. Marcus kept me intrigued in this beautiful romance that was just fitting for two strong and independent characters. My favorite, though, just had to be Rory McRoy. He was just such a sweetheart of a guy! Theres nothing that he wouldnt do to protect and support his woman. And, Neve James has all that and more when it comes to her relationship with Rory. Yes, there were some pretty heavy misunderstandings between the two, but as they work them all out, just what exactly is their connection? What does a relationship with Rory really mean to Neve? And, is she in it for the long haul? In other words, can she trust him?

This starts off as a pen pal exchange of letters as Rory is overseas on military assignment. Their friendship develops into something more as the two correspond and then finally meet. But, when Rory is caught in what seems to be a lie while Neve jumps to the wrong conclusions, their relationship suffers until Rory helps Neve see the good in him and learns to trust him again. Ahhh, the romance, which is sweet and sensual. The drama, which is conflicting and emotional. The suspense, which brings truth and understanding when everything is now out in the open. Its a story that is tenderly touching when dealing with sad but yet truly genuine concerns. The dancer and the soldier  two people wanting to find that everlasting love that they can trust in. Whos to say that they didn't find it in each other? This one is worth taking a chance on!!! Ms. Marcus again writes romance at its finest...

So loving that cover!!!!

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"As stated in another review for an electronics-dimming product I've purchased on Amazon, these are quite useful though a bit overpriced in my opinion. I had considered buying a roll of automobile tint as it's cheaper but decided against it due to the worry it wouldn't cling as well as these and some tints have adhesive on them which would be a no-go for the intended purpose of using on electronics devices.

The item works well and the cling is good and fairly stable. It won't cling to everything though so keep that in mind and instead use a small piece of electrical or duct tape if you need to. I use this mainly for some electronics devices connected to my bedroom TV but also for my large blue LED alarm clock and it works great. I have only had to readjust it once or twice in 6 months."

It can also support skin health, glucose metabolism and brain function.  I am hoping that this will be helpful for her to make her aging process healthier.

I used to keep all my siverplate, serving pieces, and napkin rings in a silverware box that was so big it had to be put in a closet where it quickly got stacked with ""stuff"" or put up too high to get without a stepstool. It seemed more bother than it was worth to use. Now all my pieces are close by and fit neatly in a smaller plasic container that fits in the cupboard with the good china.  It was so easy to set the table for my last dinner party with the ""good stuff"". I especially like that I can pull out just the number of place settings that I need without having to bring out the entire service. I haven't had them long enough to see how well they prevent tarnish, but they definitely are convenient and keep the silverplate from getting scratched."

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"I got a Kindle for Christmas and wanted to get a cute, but protective cover for it.  I did a lot of research, and M-Edge seemed to get really high reviews, so I bought one.

I got the fuchsia cover. It looks much different on my computer monitor than it does in person. On the monitor it looks more like a rose pink, but in reality it's a super bright, neon pink. I love pink, but I don't want it to stand out THAT much. It's really, really bright.

I knew this cover wasn't leather (unfortunately), but once I touched it I was disappointed in the feel of it.  Yes it is soft and smooth, but it looks and feels like plastic ""Pleather."" It really does have a bad over, but I was spoiled by leather in the past. No, it's not leather... but I knew that when I bought it, so I can't hold that against it.

Overall, I think the design of this cover is fabulous. I love how it incorporates the E-Luminator (sold separately). It's quite a slick design. I love that I can store the E-Luminator right in the case.  I also love the strap that keeps the book securely closed or open.  It folds back on itself like a dream, and is very comfortable to hold either open or folded back. The inside has a nice microfiber suede-like lining that offers protection against scratches.

It's a great case.. really great, if you don't mind the plastic cover.  I am hoping that they will offer leather versions in the future, and more color choices."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"My experience with the Kestrel 4500NV with ATRAG (and Bluetooth):

1) No indication that Kestral can be updated via flashing the firmware; if there is an ATRAG issue, you could be out of luck

2) The ""Gun Library"" software has recently become available on Horus' website (after missing for most of the year). However, the software does not appear to install correctly. (We've tested it on Windows 7 (64bit) and Windows XP (w/SP3)). The software is supposed to be able to look up factory ammunition loads from a MS Access database that installs with the software.  What you get instead is a ""DSN Driver"" error. So it doesn't appear to work properly.

3) You can finally download the settings, and you can upload them. However, you can not remove all of the guns in the Kestrel. Which is cheesy is you are trying to use the Gun Library to sync them.

4) Customer support on the Horus side seems to include many reports from people with much more time in grade, per se, than myself, of ignoring their customer base.

5) Kestrel, with generally makes great products, has an online support forum system that requires INDIVIDUAL approval of posts made. So, even when you mention something not really negative but without a positive spin on their product, the post doesnt get approved (that's not a good sign)

6) Kestrel has finally upgraded the software on their site to version 1.7, which seems to now work with Windows 7; this was previously not the case.

For a product this expensive, you'd think the software from Horus Vision would actually work properly. It doesn't.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I am not a fan of Stephen Baldwin and it is mainly through the acting of the other principles that this movie carries 4 stars, especially Kevin Spacey.  Although a bit more gratuitous violence than I like, I would consider the content to be tame by modern ""Over The Top"" action movies.  This is a movie that gets you to think and watch it again.  I actually quoted a line from the movie in a casual conversation (I do not want to spoil the plot ending) about Kaiser Sosze and got a good laugh."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"These are beautifully made pedals with SPD compatible mechanism on one side and a broad flat pedal surface on the other. My son has Shimano pedals on his race bike so I put these on his mountain bike. He uses the same shoes, so these are clearly compatible with the Shimano cleats. The tension setting on these is near the lowest setting compared to about the middle on his Shimano pedals but I think he wants to be able to get out of his mountain bike a bit more readily than his race bike. That said, about medium setting was way to tight in any case. Given he's a kid, perhaps this make sense. An adult would be more likely to be near the medium setting.

These don't rotate freely because of the bearing seals, which is good and bad. It takes just a short time to get used to rotating the pedal to get the right side and my son hasn't complained. The rub isn't noticeable while pedaling, just enough to keep the pedals fixed relative to the cranks while unloaded.

The adjustment was easy and the setting indicator was clear.

Some folks prefer the mechanism on both side so it's easier to get in and out and that makes sense if you are always using cleated shoes. The alternative of regular pedals opens up many wider platformed more grippy standard pedals which are also better pedals if you don't use cleats. So this is a compromise which works well for us. He uses his clipless shoes when he wants and regular shoes when he's out with the family."

They are not good for hiking around which I did in them the first day, but with some insoles in them, they have been very comfortable and warm! A little bigger than I expected but sometimes I wear two pair of socks so I think think I'll keep the size I have.
Waterproof so far and pretty warm! Except on wet metal (loader steps) very slip resistant. The laces are waayy too short so I had to replace them.
I had a very hard time trying to find good women's work boots with steel toe so I'm ecstatic to finally have some that had great reviews at a decent price and so far so good!

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I had never made lollipops but always wanted to. I have gotten into trying to make many new recipes and foods in the last few years and thought this would be fun so I placed my order for the mold.

The set comes with one mold and one set of sticks. If you want to make them again you would have to purchase more sticks. Our local hobby store sells them and you can order them online. The mold itself can be used in the freezer, microwave, and oven. It is also dishwasher safe;; however I could not test that as I do not own a dishwasher.

The mold does not come with any type of recipe for creating lollipops. If you look online however you can find many recipes for free. The mold only has a spot for a dozen to be made at once. For a family the size of mine, I would need to make several batches. It would be easier to have a larger set of molds or to purchase multiple sets.

The molds do not require spray as the pan is silicone and nonstick. They are easy to clean and since they are silicone and small and easy to store. I am looking forward to trying many new recipes with this mold.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Streamlight's UltraStinger is really in a niche by itself.  Mag Light's rechargeables aren't as bright and SureFire's are much more expensive, so the UltraStringer is really made for someone desiring a quality light that won't break the bank.
Some of the nice features of this light: It's very lightweight, very bright (75,000 candlepower), run time is very good for this much light output.  Well made, quality construction.
Some of the cons about this light:  Plastic lens (seems only SureFire will give you a genuine Pyrex, glass lens these days) and the spot/flood range isn't really that much of a difference (Mag's spot/flood produces a SPOT or a FLOOD).  The Streamlight has a very coarse adjustment range, really being all the same style output, with very LITTLE difference in the SPOT / FLOOD.  This isn't as bad as it sounds as the light produced is a very good, pure white light, I'd just like to see more variation in the range, but I'm being picky here.
One thing's for certain; this light is much better than Mag's rechargeable and a lesser light than SureFire's 8 or 9N rechargeable.  But, it's also half the price of the SureFire and 80% less than SureFire's 10-X.  So, I've got to give it 5 stars for being a great value, occupying a market not really served by either Mag or SureFire.
If you're a contractor or home inspector, this light is THE value on the market in a bright, quality constructed rechargeable."

1. I will admit that I have been a fan of Nora Roberts' books for a while and have enjoyed her writing. I enjoyed this book and had no issues with it. If you are looking for an easy read, this is the book. I highly recommend it. I have read a few of her books and will continue to read them as I read them. The story line is a good one and will keep you turning the pages. 2. I liked the ending and it was not just a big cliffhanger but a real good ending.

The light is not a very bright white, and it will not light up the area around the base of the flashlight.  It will not be able to illuminate the area around the flashlight.

The only issue I have is that it is not bright enough for most people.  It will not be able to illuminate the area around the base of the flashlight.  It is not as bright as a standard halogen bulb, and it does not provide enough light for most people.  It is also not as bright as a standard halogen bulb, but it is not going to be able to illuminate the area around the flashlight.  I have not used it as a flashlight yet, but I will update this review if I find any problems.

I'm a woman, and was looking for a small, lightweight messenger style bag that would fit my wallet, keys, phone & other small necessities as well as my iPad, pencil, battery charger, cords... Etc. I wanted something sturdy, simple and well designed, but that appealed to my style. This bag met all my requirements and I've been really impressed by the quality and craftsmanship. I'm surprised at how roomy it is for what I feel is a smaller bag - even loaded up with all my stuff, I've always had room to spare.
During shipping, the box was slightly damaged and the bottom front corner of the bag was dented when I unpacked it. I decided to keep it, hoping with use it would work itself out with use, but it didn't and the dent remains. It adds character... That's what I'm going with :)
The only other thing I would wish for is an extra metal slide or something to keep the loops of the long strap together. When I shorten the strap, the strap doubles across itself and doesn't function well as a single strap when I go to grab it quickly... Just a minor thing really.
Great bag, great functionality, looks awesome, quality seems like it will outlast me!"

I'm not sure how much of a improvement they can make but I don't think they should.  They sound great and I'm pleased with the sound.  If I had to guess, I'd say the sound quality is decent.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because they are very small, but I'd be happy with them if they were small enough.

I'm not sure if the speaker is that bad because it's only about 10"" wide.  The reason I give this 5 stars is because I don't like the way the sound is wired.  I was able to find some cable that worked for the price but I never heard of it.  If I had known that I could just buy a different cable that worked, I'd probably buy a different set of speakers.

UPDATE:  I contacted the seller to see if they would send me a replacement pair of speakers.  They told me that they would not and I was able to order one of these.  I was able to send them a replacement pair of speakers but I still have a problem.

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,The camera is amazing in every way except for that it has a noticeable shake on the outside edge when shooting in 4k mounted on a tripod. This is a very well known issue with this camera and they claimed to have fixed it with a firmware patch but after applying the firmware the problem still remains. Even when you disable the steady shot feature it still happens so something else is causing the optics to vibrate inside of the camera. Sony has been little help so far with correcting the issue and even claimed the couldn't tell when I sent them a video clearly illustrating the problem. The truth is the issue isn't that bad and you have to 'notice it' and in all honestly the other features of the camera still make it my primary camera with anything I shoot for Barnacules Nerdgasm on YouTube.

The bulbs are very very white without the fixture covers of the chandelier. My chandelier has an offwhite/yellowish cover over each that is open ended. That makes the light look warm. Without that, these are cool white (I ordered the 6000K bulbs because of the covers). I had 4 of the 25 watt halogens in my chandelier drawing 100 watts total. With these bulbs, I am drawing only 3 watts each at 12 watts total. It is just as bright. The bulbs should last a lot longer and didn't cost any more than the halogens I bought at Wal-Mart. I would suggest getting warm white if not going into a fixture that warms the light...that is unless you like super white light."

It is in good shape, and it is going to stay that way. I am very happy with this product and will be purchasing more of it. I highly recommend this product. Love these! Easy to use and easy to clean!Love this very nice quality."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Works well with most Z-Wave home automation systems; I'm using this with Vera. The lock itself is solidly constructed and can hold up to a lot of use. The drive system has enough torque to operate the lock when used on ill-fitting doors, hasty installations, or when the door is being pushed while opening or locking. The keypad is easily visible in all kinds of light. Battery life is excellent. Has decent enough range to be used a good distance away from the home automation device or other Z-Wave devices without needing a repeater, so it works well for back doors or doors on different stories of the house. Comes with high-strength hardware that will require slight reworking of the door jamb in order to use, but is worth it. Codes are easily added, changed or deleted, with temporary one-time use codes as an option. Numerous other settings and features for alarms, tamper detection, general lock operation notifications and more. Installs like any other deadbolt."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"I struggle with a rating for this book, as it is beautiful, thought provoking, and elegant. But between the multiple narrators and the stream of consciousness style, it is a tough read. I recommend those who are advanced readers, and who can handle the complicated narration. But if you aren't an English teacher or a bibliophile, this book will probably make you crazy. It was even tough for me to get through the first third of the book. If you stick with it, and get use to the flow of her writing, you won't regret it."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,CG,"First off I returned this pair. The quality is just what I wanted, just the right amount of cushioning.  The front of the shoe is a little tight on the inside, but it's okay.  I wear a medium, and it fits perfectly.  I would definitely buy from this seller again.  I did get a size large and it fit perfectly.  I will say that I had to take a few items off.  I have a hard time finding shoes that fit me well, so I returned them.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I highly recommend it.Good quality, great price.  I ordered a size up to get the best fit.I have been wearing a size 10 for years and I can tell you that I am very pleased with this purchase.  It is very comfortable and I have no complaints.  I am 5'8"" and the dress was just right for my husband.  It was a gift for him and he is very happy with it.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.I like this belt.  It is very comfortable.  It is a little large in the waist but it fits well.  It is not a very high quality belt.  It is a good quality and lightweight belt.  The material is very soft and the leather is very durable.  I am very pleased with the quality of this belt.  I am a 42D and ordered a large.  I do have a small waist and it fits perfectly.  I think the size I ordered would be a bit tighter and that would be fine for me.  The material is nice and thick and the buckle is made of"
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,As it comes it is not much use.  Like others I replaced the sand paper like covering with carpet with double faced tape.  Another negative is that if you are using this in your driveway the thing will slip right off the car unless you are supporting it.  There are no rubber feet or anything to help it grab the surface.  With my 80 pound lab it is very difficult to guide him while holding the ramp in place with my foot. He is finally getting used to it but it has slipped out from under him twice causing him to be very wary of it.  Not sure how to remedy that.  But when it works it is very helpful. I cannot lift my 10 year old boy into the car and as he ages he (WE) will need it more and more.

The basic instruction booklet includes a lot of pictures of the model and the flight dynamics. The instructions also include a video to learn the electronics. The instructions are very easy to follow and follow, which is great for kids who like to fly. The flight dynamics are very well done and the video is very useful. The battery life is very good and it is very easy to charge"
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,CG,"This kitchen is adorable! Here's what I love:

- The kitchen is a little large, but is so small that it's not too small for the little kids to take in. - The kitchen is in a large storage case. - The kitchen has a lot of storage space. - The kitchen has a matching plastic table with several pieces of furniture. Overall, I think this kitchen is pretty good. It's easy to clean, and the kids love to play with it. The little kids will really enjoy playing with it, and it's a great addition to their kitchen. I'll be keeping this review as a Christmas present for my kids. I have been playing with this at work for over a year now and I've had no problems. I have a little girl who loves it and I'm happy to say that it's not quite as bad as I thought it would be. I've had it for a few months now and it's still going strong and I'm happy to say that it's not quite as bad as I thought it would be. It's not quite as big as I thought it would be, but it's still pretty darn cute. I don't think it's going to hurt my kids, but it's a good size for a little kid. It's well made and it's very well made. I received this item as a gift for my grandson. He is 5 years old and loves it. He loves it. Very cute. My granddaughter loves it."
Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"My daughter liked the included doll and pet (note its only 1 pet, not 3 like the Amazon description says). She didn't like the house itself much and i cant blame her. Its a cute little house but one that is badly made.

You pretty much need to assemble everything which is a pain. I'd say it would be a good exercise for a kid but my 12 year old couldn't assemble it on her own. I probably spent 45min assembling it. Alot of the pieces didn't properly snap on and i have no doubt it will pop off with continual play. The door is horrendous, it easily open ands doesnt stay closed. The background of the house inside is just a cardboard you slot in. The finished product is a good size; not too big or too small.

They included like 50 small stickers and my daughter loves stickers though so she did have alot of fun sticking them on the house and customizing it. She is also having alot of fun with the mobile app. But in the end, i wouldnt recommend this. If you kid really wants a LPS toy i would pass on this."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I haven't rated a book with 5 stars in a long time, but I loved the craftsmanship with which Alice Hoffman wrote this book. She didn't rush through her plot strands; she tied all the pieces of the plot together; she took time to make reflections on life.  I was most impressed and enjoyed reading this novel.  I enjoyed the way each of the Sparrow women made a contribution to their bloodline.  Some readers may feel that there is too much narration and not enough dialogue which occurred to me at first, but I found the author's writing skills balanced out my preference for dialogue.  I would definitely recommend this book to my friends."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Barbet Schroeder is a very talented director. His main concerns have always been related with the dark side of the human soul.

This singular movie is a very careful analysis of the human psyche seen under a prism. Schroeder would have minutely followed the traces of ""The crime considered as one of the finest arts"" , the smart essay of Thomas de Quincey. Hitchcock, certainly inspired himself to make his famous movie: ""The Rope"".

But if you analyze the smart script with major intensity, you will find clever clues, like the first shot, in that enraptured camera movement that came into the hall window reminds us to: Psycho.

But there is still more, the well known mechanism of oppression and subjection between this weird couple is expressed with genuine fineness through expressive narrative ellipsis.

On the other hand we have to Sandra Bullock' s character who decides to investigate them through the night with a camera; which suggests us a modern Peeping Tom; I mean: James Stewart's role in ""The rear window"".

And finally we have the climatic sequence is another glorious tribute to ""Vertigo"". If you take into account all these hidden traces you will have to admit only Schroeder avoided this thriller had reached so higher peaks.

Perhaps, the only default of the movie resides in the limited scale of psychological grimaces of Sandra Bullock, but this is a minor failure in this intelligently unusual thriller."

I have a pair of these for my son and my husband.  I highly recommend these to anyone who needs one.This is a great tool for camping or backpacking. The mount is very secure, and it is well built. The front and back of the case are easy to adjust and it holds the keys. The pocket clip on the front of the case is well made and has a nice pocket clip for my phone and keys. The mount was a little too tight, but that is no big deal. The batteries in the case are on the low side, and the side of the case is tight.

It does not cover the dog's face as well as the back of the neck.  The harness does have the added benefit of allowing the dog to walk without being pushed into a corner.  This is not a big deal for us, because we have a very small dog and it is easy to get lost in the park.  I am not sure how long it will hold, but it will be long enough that it will be a challenge to get it to hold for a long time.  The harness is also very large for my dog.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"I won't mince words: this book is a complete downer. The first half consists of Eileens diatribe, a scathing attack on her father, herself, her life. But the writing marks Ottessa Moshfegh as an author to watch.

Moshfegh gives us a thoroughly dislikeable narrator in the scrawny, shambolic shape of Eileen who has an unspeakable attitude, appalling habits and an entirely dysfunctional relationship with her alcoholic ex-cop father. They live in utter squalor in a town Eileen refers to only as X-ville. She works in the office of a local correctional facility for young male offenders and doesnt have a friend in the worlduntil one day Rebecca walks into the workplace. Beautiful, glamorous, confident  Rebecca is everything Eileen is not. But is Rebecca for real?

The ominous tone hanging over this story is compounded by the frequent phrases of foreboding generously scattered throughout. I have to say I'm not a fan of this device - it's rather too manipulative of the reader - and as is so often the case, the outcome doesn't quite live up to the suspense nor is the character of Rebecca satisfactorily explained. The book is by no means an easy read in terms of its seedy subject matter but it is, nevertheless, an interesting, fearless and thoughtful piece of work."

Most privacy screens that were the right size had a design that could only be used vertically and were max of 36 inches wide, so wouldn't work for us.
