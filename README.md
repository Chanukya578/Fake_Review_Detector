# Fake_Review_Detector

## Project Overview: 
This project aims to detect fake reviews (Computer-Generated or Fake - CG) vs original reviews (Human-Written - OR) using **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques** and **Machine Learning models**. The system processes textual data, extracts meaningful features, trains multiple classifiers, and combines their outputs using an **ensemble learning approach** to enhance detection accuracy.
